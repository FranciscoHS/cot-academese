    "question": "Consider the integral $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{19.00} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$. Develop analytical formulas that approximate $I(\\epsilon)$ for different regimes of $\\epsilon$.",
    "solution": "\n    The integral is of the form $I(\\epsilon) = \\int_0^{19} \\frac{1}{\\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.\n    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to  $frac{1}{\\epsilon}$.\n\n    For small  $epsilon$,\n    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.\n    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \\epsilon$.\n    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \\left( \\frac{1}{8.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/7.0} $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.743}{\\epsilon^{0.8571}}}$.\n\n    For an intermediate regime where  $epsilon$ is large,\n    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.\n    The width is approximated as  $ \\left( \\frac{1}{8.0*\\epsilon} \\right)^{1/7.0}  $.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{0.743}{\\epsilon^{0.8571}}}$.\n\n    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large  $epsilon$.\n    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as  $frac{L}{\\epsilon}$.\n    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\\epsilon) = \\frac{19}{\\epsilon}}$.\n\n    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large  $epsilon$ are  $boxed{\\frac{0.743}{\\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \\frac{0.743}{\\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \\frac{19}{\\epsilon}}$.\n    ",
