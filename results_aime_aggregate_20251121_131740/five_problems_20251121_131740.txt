--- CHAIN OF THOUGHT ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thinking block 1]
Let me work through these AIME problems one by one.

PROBLEM 1: 
We need polynomials $a_8x^8 + ... + a_0$ divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.

$x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ has roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

For divisibility, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^0 = 1, \omega^1 = \omega, \omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1, \omega^4 = \omega, \omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1, \omega^7 = \omega, \omega^8 = \omega^2$

So $P(\omega) = a_0 + a_1\omega + a_2\omega^2 + a_3 + a_4\omega + a_5\omega^2 + a_6 + a_7\omega + a_8\omega^2 = 0$

This gives us: $(a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$

Since $1, \omega, \omega^2$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{Q}$, we need:
- $a_0 + a_3 + a_6 = 0$


- $a_1 + a_4 + a_7 = 0$
- $a_2 + a_5 + a_8 = 0$

I'll count the possible solutions systematically. Each equation requires three variables from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ to sum to zero. By careful enumeration, there are 7 ways to do this. 

Since we have three independent equations with the same constraint, the total number of valid polynomials is $7^3 = 343$.

Let's factor $n$ as $2^a \cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd number. This decomposition reveals key relationships between $n$, $2n$, and $n^2$.

The least common multiple depends on the maximum power of 2. When $a \geq 1$, the LCM equals $n^2$, which must satisfy $n^2 = 62n - 336$.

Solving this quadratic yields $n = 48$ or $n = 14$, consistent with the requirement that $n$ be even.

When $a = 0$, the LCM becomes $2n^2$, leading to a different quadratic equation. This case produces $n = 7$ as the sole odd solution.

Combining both cases gives three
