Problem 1 - Budget 1024 tokens - 2025-11-21
Type: integral
================================================================================

ANSWER: Partially Correct

Why? 
The model correctly identifies that it needs to use Laplace's method, and that 
the integral cannot be solved analytically. The final answer is roughly of the 
correct form, but the coefficients are slightly off.

THINKING SUMMARY (total tokens: 709):
All of the reasoning looks fairly concrete, with math symbols appearing 
throughout. No flowery language observed.

OBSERVATIONS:
The model stopped before the allowed budget was fully expended (709 tokens used vs 1024 budget) even though it did not arrive at the correct response and its train-of-though qualitatively appears to have been interrupted:

"The function seems to be increasing near zero, suggesting the maximum might exist in the positive region within the interval $[-0.8, 0.6]$. I'll investigate potential critical points where the derivative changes sign." - It ends here.
