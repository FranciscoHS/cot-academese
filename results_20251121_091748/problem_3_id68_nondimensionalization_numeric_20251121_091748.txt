QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nondimensionalize the polynomial \[P(x) = x^{10} - 6 x^{2} + 8\] into a polynomial of the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^{2} \pm 1$. Solve for $\epsilon$.

REFERENCE SOLUTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
For now, we ignore the numeric values of the coefficients and instead call them $a_1, a_2, a_3$. Our polynomial is then: $a_{1} x^{10} - a_{2} x^{2} + a_{3}.$  Use the substitution $x=y \sqrt{\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}},$ 
which gives the expression  $frac{a_{1} a_{3}^{5} y^{10}}{a_{2}^{5}} - a_{3} y^{2} + a_{3}.$ 
Divide all terms by the coefficient remaining in front of the constant term, giving us the nondimensionalized polynomial with coefficients in terms of $a_1, a_2, a_3$:   $frac{a_{1} a_{3}^{4} y^{10}}{a_{2}^{5}} - y^{2} + 1$ 
Substituting in the known numeric values for $a_1, a_2, a_3$ (using their absolute values as we have already accounted for sign), we get:   $frac{128 y^{10}}{243} - y^{2} + 1$ 
From inspection of this nondimensionalized equation, we can now identify  $epsilon$:  $ \epsilon=\frac{128}{243}\implies \boxed{\epsilon \approx0.53}.$ 

EXPECTED ANSWER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
0.53

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $P(x) = x^{10} - 6x^2 + 8$ into the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

To nondimensionalize, we need to make a substitution $x = \alpha y$ for some scaling factor $\alpha$, and then factor out appropriate constants to get the desired form.

Let's substitute $x = \alpha y$:
$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8$
$= \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$

We want this to be in the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

Let's factor out a constant. Looking at the desired form, the constant term should be $\pm 1$, so we should factor out $8$:

$P(\alpha y) = 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1\right)$
$= 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1\right)$

For this to be in the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$, we need:
- The coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$
- The coefficient of $y^{10}$ to be $\epsilon$
- The constant term to be $\pm 1$

So we need $\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$, which gives us $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$, so $\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$.


$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$ confirms our scaling factor. We calculate $\epsilon$ by substituting this value, finding $\frac{1}{8} \cdot \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^{10} = \frac{128}{243}$, which precisely scales the $y^{10}$ term as required.

The resulting polynomial transforms to $8\left(\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1\right)$, capturing the intricate relationship between the coefficients and the base scaling.

Looking at the polynomial $P(x) = x^{10} - 6x^2 + 8$, I need to transform it into the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

I'll use the substitution $x = \alpha y$ for some scaling factor $\alpha$ to be determined.

Substituting $x = \alpha y$:
$$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8 = \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$$

To get the desired form, I need the constant term to be $\pm 1$. Since we have $+8$, I'll factor out $8$:

$$P(\alpha y) = 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1\right) = 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1\right)$$

For this to match the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$, I need:
- The coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$
- The coefficient of $y^{10}$ to be $\epsilon$
- The constant term to be $\pm 1$ (already satisfied)

Setting the coefficient of $y^2$ equal to $-1$:
$$\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$$

Solving for $\alpha$:
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$
$$\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

Now I can find $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8}$$

Since $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$, we have:
$$\alpha^{10} = (\alpha^2)^5 = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{4^5}{3^5} = \frac{1024}{243}$$

Therefore:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} = \frac{1024}{243 \cdot 8} = \frac{1024}{1944} = \frac{128}{243}$$

The nondimensionalized form is:
$$8\left(\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1\right)$$

Therefore, $\epsilon = \frac{128}{243}$.

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $P(x) = x^{10} - 6x^2 + 8$ into a form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

To nondimensionalize, we make a substitution $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter and $y$ is the new dimensionless variable.

Let's substitute $x = \alpha y$ into $P(x)$:
$$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8$$
$$= \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$$

We want this to be of the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

Looking at the constant term, we need the constant term to be $\pm 1$. Currently we have $+8$, so we need to divide the entire polynomial by 8:

$$\frac{P(\alpha y)}{8} = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1$$
$$= \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1$$

Now we want the coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$. We have $-\frac{3\alpha^2}{4}$, so we need:
$$\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$$
$$3\alpha^2 = 4$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$
$$\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

With this value of $\alpha$, the coefficient of $y^{10}$ becomes:


$$\epsilon = \frac{(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}})^{10}}{8} = \frac{1024}{243 \cdot 8} = \frac{1024}{1944}$$

I calculate the scaling parameter $\epsilon$ by raising $\alpha$ to the 10th power and dividing by 8, resulting in a precise fractional value that allows nondimensionalization of the original polynomial.

To simplify, I find the greatest common divisor between 1024 and 1944, which is 8. Dividing both numerator and denominator by 8 yields the reduced fraction $\frac{128}{243}$, representing the final nondimensional form of the parameter.

The equation now becomes $\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1$, with $\epsilon$ definitively equal to $\frac{128}{243}$.

Let me use the substitution $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter.

Substituting $x = \alpha y$:
$$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8 = \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$$

To get the constant term to be $\pm 1$, I'll divide the entire expression by 8:
$$\frac{P(\alpha y)}{8} = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1 = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1$$

For the coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$, I need:
$$\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$$

Solving for $\alpha$:
$$3\alpha^2 = 4$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$
$$\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

Now I can find $\epsilon$ by calculating the coefficient of $y^{10}$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8}$$

Computing $\alpha^{10}$:
$$\alpha^{10} = \left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)^{10} = \frac{2^{10}}{(\sqrt{3})^{10}} = \frac{2^{10}}{3^5} = \frac{1024}{243}$$

Therefore:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} = \frac{1024}{243 \cdot 8} = \frac{1024}{1944}$$

Simplifying this fraction:
$$\epsilon = \frac{1024}{1944} = \frac{128}{243}$$

The nondimensionalized form is:
$$\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1$$

Therefore, $\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{128}{243}}$.

I need to nondimensionalize the polynomial $P(x) = x^{10} - 6x^2 + 8$ into the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

To nondimensionalize, I need to introduce a scaling factor. Let me set $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is some scaling parameter and $y$ is the dimensionless variable.

Substituting $x = \alpha y$ into the original polynomial:
$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8$
$P(\alpha y) = \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$

I want this to be in the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

Looking at the target form, the constant term should be $\pm 1$, so I need:
$8 = \pm 1$

This means I need to divide the entire polynomial by 8 to make the constant term equal to 1:

$\frac{P(\alpha y)}{8} = \frac{\alpha^{10} y^{10}}{8} - \frac{6\alpha^2 y^2}{8} + \frac{8}{8}$
$\frac{P(\alpha y)}{8} = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1$
$\frac{P(\alpha y)}{8} = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1$

Now I want the coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$. So I need:


$\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$
$3\alpha^2 = 4$
$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$
$\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$

I calculate the scaling parameter $\alpha$ to transform the polynomial into the desired nondimensional form. By dividing by 8 and adjusting $\alpha$, I've made the constant term 1 and the $y^2$ coefficient 1.

The coefficient of $y^{10}$ becomes $\frac{1024}{1944}$, which simplifies to $\frac{128}{243}$. I verify this by checking the key transformations: the $y^2$ coefficient is indeed $-1$, confirming my algebraic manipulations.

The final nondimensionalized equation emerges with $\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1$, definitively establishing $\epsilon$ as $\frac{128}{243}$. This precise value captures the essential scaling relationship in the mathematical derivation.

Looking at this problem, I need to find a scaling transformation that converts the given polynomial into the desired form.

Let me introduce a scaling parameter by setting $x = \alpha y$, where $\alpha$ is to be determined and $y$ is the dimensionless variable.

Substituting into the original polynomial:
$$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8 = \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$$

To get the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$, I need the constant term to be $\pm 1$. Since the constant term is 8, I'll divide the entire expression by 8:

$$\frac{P(\alpha y)}{8} = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1 = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1$$

For this to match the target form, I need the coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$. Setting:
$$\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$$

Solving for $\alpha$:
$$3\alpha^2 = 4$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$
$$\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

Now I can find $\epsilon$, which is the coefficient of $y^{10}$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8}$$

Since $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$, I have:
$$\alpha^{10} = (\alpha^2)^5 = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{4^5}{3^5} = \frac{1024}{243}$$

Therefore:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} = \frac{1024}{8 \cdot 243} = \frac{128}{243}$$

The nondimensionalized polynomial is:
$$\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1$$

Therefore, $\epsilon = \frac{128}{243}$.

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $P(x) = x^{10} - 6x^2 + 8$ into a polynomial of the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

To nondimensionalize, we need to introduce a new variable $y$ such that $x = \alpha y$ for some scaling factor $\alpha$. Then we substitute this into $P(x)$ and factor out constants to get the desired form.

Let $x = \alpha y$. Then:
$$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8$$
$$= \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$$

We want this to be in the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$.

Looking at the constant term, we want the constant term to be $\pm 1$. We have a constant term of $8$, so we need to factor out $8$:

$$P(\alpha y) = 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1\right)$$
$$= 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{3\alpha^2}{4} y^2 + 1\right)$$

For this to be in the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$, we need the coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$. So we need:
$$-\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = -1$$

This gives us:
$$\frac{3\alpha^2}{4} = 1$$


$$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$
$$\alpha = \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$$

I'll calculate $\epsilon$ by raising $\alpha$ to the 10th power and dividing by 8. Using $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$, I'll compute $\alpha^{10}$ as $(\alpha^2)^5$, which simplifies to $\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^5$.

The result is $\frac{1024}{243}$, so $\epsilon$ becomes $\frac{1024}{243 \cdot 8} = \frac{128}{243}$.

I verify the key steps: $4^5 = 1024$, $3^5 = 243$, and dividing numerator and denominator by 8 confirms the fraction.

I'm now considering how to express this in a nondimensionalized form, focusing on the signs and potential factoring of the constant.

The goal is to create an expression $P(\alpha y) = C \cdot (\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1)$, where $C$ is a specific constant.

By examining the coefficients, I determine $C = 8$ and $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$. This allows me to calculate $\epsilon$ as $\frac{\alpha^{10}}{C}$, which matches my previous calculations.

Specifically, $\alpha^{10} = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{1024}{243}$, leading to $\epsilon = \frac{1024}{243 \cdot 8} = \frac{128}{243}$.

I verify the result by substituting back into the original polynomial, confirming the nondimensionalized form yields $\frac{1024}{243} y^{10} - 8y^2 + 8$.

With $x = \alpha y$ and $\alpha^{2} = \frac{4}{3}$, the polynomial $P(\alpha y)$ matches the expected structure, validating $\epsilon = \frac{128}{243}$. The signs align perfectly with the problem's desired form of $\epsilon y^{10} - y^2 + 1$.

Looking at the polynomial $P(x) = x^{10} - 6x^2 + 8$, I need to introduce a scaling transformation $x = \alpha y$ to nondimensionalize it.

Let me substitute $x = \alpha y$ into the polynomial:
$$P(\alpha y) = (\alpha y)^{10} - 6(\alpha y)^2 + 8$$
$$= \alpha^{10} y^{10} - 6\alpha^2 y^2 + 8$$

To get the form $\epsilon y^{10} \pm y^2 \pm 1$, I need to factor out an appropriate constant. I want:
- The coefficient of $y^2$ to be $\pm 1$
- The constant term to be $\pm 1$

Looking at the constant term, if I factor out 8:
$$P(\alpha y) = 8\left(\frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} y^{10} - \frac{6\alpha^2}{8} y^2 + 1\right)$$

For the $y^2$ coefficient to be $-1$, I need:
$$-\frac{6\alpha^2}{8} = -1$$

Solving for $\alpha$:
$$\frac{6\alpha^2}{8} = 1$$
$$6\alpha^2 = 8$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$$

Now I can find $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8}$$

Since $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$:
$$\alpha^{10} = (\alpha^2)^5 = \left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^5 = \frac{4^5}{3^5} = \frac{1024}{243}$$

Therefore:
$$\epsilon = \frac{\alpha^{10}}{8} = \frac{1024/243}{8} = \frac{1024}{243 \times 8} = \frac{1024}{1944} = \frac{128}{243}$$

Let me verify: With $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha^2 = \frac{4}{3}$, the nondimensionalized form becomes:
$$P(\alpha y) = 8\left(\frac{128}{243} y^{10} - y^2 + 1\right)$$

This is indeed of the form $\epsilon y^{10} - y^2 + 1$.

Therefore, $\epsilon = \boxed{\frac{128}{243}}$.
