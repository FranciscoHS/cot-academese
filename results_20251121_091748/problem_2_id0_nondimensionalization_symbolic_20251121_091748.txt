QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Nondimensionalize the polynomial\[a_{1} x^{7} + a_{2} x^{2} + a_{3}\]into one of the form $\\epsilon y^{7} + y^{2} + 1.$Express $\\epsilon$ as a function of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3.$

REFERENCE SOLUTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
We begin with the substitution $x=y \sqrt{\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}}$ 
This gives the expression $a_{1} y^{7} \left(\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}} + a_{3} y^{2} + a_{3}$ 
Divide by the coefficient remaining in front of the constant, leaving us with the nondimensionalized polynomial with coefficients in terms of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$: $ \boxed{\frac{a_{1} y^{7} \left(\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}}}{a_{3}} + y^{2} + 1}.$ By inspection, we can see that $ \boxed{\epsilon=\frac{a_{1} \left(\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}}}{a_{3}}}.$ 

EXPECTED ANSWER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\frac{a_{1} \left(\frac{a_{3}}{a_{2}}\right)^{\frac{7}{2}}}{a_{3}}

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

Let me use a substitution $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is some scaling factor to be determined.

Substituting $x = \alpha y$ into the original polynomial:
$a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3$
$= a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$

I want this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So I need:
- Coefficient of $y^7$: $a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$
- Coefficient of $y^2$: $a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$  
- Constant term: $a_3 = 1$

Wait, that's not quite right. I need to be more careful about the scaling.

Let me try a different approach. Let's scale the entire polynomial by some factor $\beta$:

$\frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3)$

And also substitute $x = \alpha y$:

$\frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3)$
$= \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} y^7 + \frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{\beta} y^2 + \frac{a_3}{\beta}$

I want this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.


I'll determine the scaling factors to match the desired nondimensional form.

First, I see that $\beta$ directly relates to the constant term. By setting $\frac{a_3}{\beta} = 1$, I can determine $\beta$ as $a_3$. 

Next, I'll solve for $\alpha$ by using the coefficient of $y^2$. This means $\frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{a_3} = 1$, which implies $\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$.

Substituting these values into the first equation, I derive an expression for $\epsilon$ involving the original coefficients. Specifically, $\epsilon$ becomes $\frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$, which elegantly connects the initial scaling parameters.

Looking at this problem, I need to find a transformation that converts the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

I'll use two transformations:
1. A scaling of the variable: $x = \alpha y$ 
2. A scaling of the entire polynomial: multiply by $\frac{1}{\beta}$

Applying these transformations:
$$\frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3) = \frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3)$$

$$= \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} y^7 + \frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{\beta} y^2 + \frac{a_3}{\beta}$$

For this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, I need:

- Coefficient of $y^7$: $\frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} = \epsilon$
- Coefficient of $y^2$: $\frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{\beta} = 1$  
- Constant term: $\frac{a_3}{\beta} = 1$

From the constant term equation:
$$\beta = a_3$$

From the $y^2$ coefficient equation:
$$\frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{a_3} = 1$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$$
$$\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$$

From the $y^7$ coefficient equation:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} = \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{a_3}$$

Since $\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$, we have:
$$\alpha^7 = \left(\sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}\right)^7 = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

Therefore:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2} = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{a_3^{7/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

$$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}}$$

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

To nondimensionalize, we need to introduce a change of variables. Let's say $x = \alpha y$ for some scaling factor $\alpha$ to be determined.

Substituting this into our original polynomial:
$a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3$
$= a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$

We want this to be in the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So we need:
- Coefficient of $y^7$: $a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$
- Coefficient of $y^2$: $a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$
- Constant term: $a_3 = 1$

Wait, that last condition $a_3 = 1$ is problematic. We can't just set $a_3 = 1$ arbitrarily. Let me think about this differently.

Actually, let me scale the entire polynomial. If we have $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$, we can factor out $a_3$ (assuming $a_3 \neq 0$):

$a_3 \left( \frac{a_1}{a_3} x^7 + \frac{a_2}{a_3} x^2 + 1 \right)$

Now let's set $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is to be determined:

$a_3 \left( \frac{a_1}{a_3} \alpha^7 y^7 + \frac{a_2}{a_3} \alpha^2 y^2 + 1 \right)$


$= a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$

I see we can derive conditions for $\alpha$ that relate the coefficients. Specifically, $a_1 \alpha^7$ must equal $\epsilon$, and $a_2 \alpha^2$ must equal 1. This gives me a systematic way to choose the scaling factor.

The requirement that $a_3$ must be 1 feels restrictive. I want a more flexible transformation strategy that allows more polynomial variations.

My new approach involves introducing two scaling parameters: $\beta$ for variable substitution and $\gamma$ for overall polynomial scaling. By substituting $x = \beta y$, I can manipulate the polynomial's structure more systematically.

Comparing coefficients reveals three key constraints:
- $\gamma a_1 \beta^7$ determines $\epsilon$
- $\gamma a_2 \beta^2$ must equal 1
- $\gamma a_3$ needs to equal 1

I can derive $\gamma$ as $\frac{1}{a_3}$ and $\beta^2$ as $\frac{a_3}{a_2}$, assuming non-zero coefficients. This provides a structured method to transform polynomials while maintaining their essential characteristics.

The resulting expression for $\epsilon$ emerges through careful algebraic manipulation, yielding $\frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$ as the final coefficient.

Looking at this nondimensionalization problem, I need to find a transformation that converts the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

I'll use a two-step approach: a change of variables followed by scaling the entire polynomial.

**Step 1: Change of variables**
Let me substitute $x = \beta y$ where $\beta$ is a scaling factor to be determined.

The polynomial becomes:
$$a_1(\beta y)^7 + a_2(\beta y)^2 + a_3 = a_1\beta^7 y^7 + a_2\beta^2 y^2 + a_3$$

**Step 2: Scale the polynomial**
Now I'll multiply the entire polynomial by a factor $\gamma$:
$$\gamma(a_1\beta^7 y^7 + a_2\beta^2 y^2 + a_3) = \gamma a_1\beta^7 y^7 + \gamma a_2\beta^2 y^2 + \gamma a_3$$

**Step 3: Match coefficients**
For this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, I need:
- Coefficient of $y^7$: $\gamma a_1\beta^7 = \epsilon$
- Coefficient of $y^2$: $\gamma a_2\beta^2 = 1$  
- Constant term: $\gamma a_3 = 1$

**Step 4: Solve for the scaling factors**
From the constant term equation: $\gamma = \frac{1}{a_3}$ (assuming $a_3 \neq 0$)

From the $y^2$ coefficient equation: 
$$\frac{1}{a_3} \cdot a_2\beta^2 = 1$$
$$\beta^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$$ (assuming $a_2 \neq 0$)

**Step 5: Find $\epsilon$**
From the $y^7$ coefficient equation:
$$\epsilon = \gamma a_1\beta^7 = \frac{1}{a_3} \cdot a_1 \cdot \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

Simplifying:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{a_3^{7/2}}{a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1 a_3^{7/2}}{a_3 a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}}$$

Let me think about this step by step. I want to find a substitution $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is some scaling factor, such that when I substitute this into the original polynomial, I get something of the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So let's substitute $x = \alpha y$:
$a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3$
$= a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$

I want this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So I need:
- Coefficient of $y^7$: $a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$
- Coefficient of $y^2$: $a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$
- Constant term: $a_3 = 1$

From the second equation: $\alpha^2 = \frac{1}{a_2}$, so $\alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a_2}}$ (assuming $a_2 > 0$).

From the third equation: $a_3 = 1$.

From the first equation: $\epsilon = a_1 \alpha^7 = a_1 \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{a_2}}\right)^7 = a_1 \cdot \frac{1}{a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1}{a_2^{7/2}}$.
 
I realize I need to first divide the entire polynomial by $a_3$ to ensure the constant term is 1. This will help me create the desired nondimensional form more accurately.

By substituting $x = \alpha y$, I derive a system of conditions for scaling. I'll solve for $\alpha$ to match the desired coefficients, ensuring $y^7$ has coefficient $\epsilon$ and $y^2$ has coefficient 1. The constant term naturally checks out, confirming my approach.

From the second equation, $\alpha^2$ equals $\frac{a_3}{a_2}$. Using this, I calculate $\epsilon$ by manipulating the first equation's coefficient, expressing it as $\frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$. This algebraic transformation systematically relates the coefficients $a_1, a_2, a_3$ to the scaling parameter $\alpha$.

Looking at this nondimensionalization problem, I need to find a transformation that converts the given polynomial into the desired form.

Let me start by dividing the original polynomial by the constant term $a_3$ to normalize it:
$$\frac{a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3}{a_3} = \frac{a_1}{a_3} x^7 + \frac{a_2}{a_3} x^2 + 1$$

Now I'll introduce a scaling transformation $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter to be determined. Substituting this:
$$\frac{a_1}{a_3} (\alpha y)^7 + \frac{a_2}{a_3} (\alpha y)^2 + 1 = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \alpha^7 y^7 + \frac{a_2}{a_3} \alpha^2 y^2 + 1$$

For this to match the desired form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, I need:

**Coefficient of $y^2$:** 
$$\frac{a_2}{a_3} \alpha^2 = 1$$

This gives me: $\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$, so $\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$

**Coefficient of $y^7$:** 
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \alpha^7$$

Substituting the value of $\alpha$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \left(\sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}\right)^7 = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{(a_3)^{7/2}}{(a_2)^{7/2}}$$

Simplifying:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1 \cdot a_3^{7/2}}{a_3 \cdot a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

Therefore: $$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}}$$

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

Let's think about this step by step. We need to find a transformation $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is some scaling factor, and we also need to scale the entire polynomial by some factor.

Let's say we transform $x = \alpha y$ and scale the polynomial by a factor $\beta$. Then:

$\beta(a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3) = \beta a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + \beta a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + \beta a_3$
$= \beta a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + \beta a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + \beta a_3$

We want this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So we need:
- $\beta a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$
- $\beta a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$
- $\beta a_3 = 1$

From the third equation: $\beta = \frac{1}{a_3}$

From the second equation: $\beta a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$
$\frac{1}{a_3} \cdot a_2 \cdot \alpha^2 = 1$
$\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$
$\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$ (assuming we take the positive square root)

From the first equation: $\epsilon = \beta a_1 \alpha^7$


$\epsilon = \frac{1}{a_3} \cdot a_1 \cdot \left(\sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}\right)^7$
$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$

I'll simplify the expression further by manipulating the coefficients and exponents to get a compact representation of $\epsilon$.

The key steps involve breaking down the square root and rearranging the terms to create a more streamlined algebraic form. By raising the fraction to the 7/2 power, I can consolidate the terms and reduce the complexity of the expression.

2^{7/2}}$

, I recognize critical constraints on the variables. The transformation requires $a_2$ and $a_3$ to share the same sign, ensuring $\frac{a_3}{a_2} > 0$. Additionally, both $a_2$ and $a_3$ must be non-zero for the calculation to be valid.

When $a_2$ and $a_3$ are positive, the square root operation becomes straightforward, allowing for a clean algebraic manipulation of the terms.

If the signs are negative, the ratio still maintains a positive value, preserving the mathematical integrity of the transformation. This systematic approach ensures the polynomial can be converted to a standardized canonical form through careful variable substitution and scaling.

The goal is to restructure the original polynomial $p(x) = a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into a normalized expression, using a strategic change of variables and scaling factor.

By expanding the transformed polynomial and matching coefficients, we derive key relationships: the scaling factor $\beta$ depends directly on $a_3$, the variable transformation $\alpha$ connects $a_2$ and $a_3$, and the final coefficient $\epsilon$ relates to the original leading coefficient $a_1$.

The critical constraint emerges from the second condition, linking $\alpha$ to the ratio of coefficients through a precise square root relationship. This enables a systematic method to standardize the polynomial's structure.

The derived expression for $\epsilon$ elegantly captures the intricate dependencies between the original coefficients $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$, representing a sophisticated algebraic transformation that preserves the polynomial's fundamental characteristics.

By strategically selecting $\alpha$ as the positive square root and $\beta$ as the reciprocal of $a_3$, I've systematically manipulated the algebraic terms to confirm the consistency of the derived relationship. The step-by-step verification demonstrates the precise interplay between these parameters, revealing a symmetric and structured mathematical relationship.

The algebraic manipulation shows how $\epsilon$ emerges from the carefully constructed combination of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, with each term contributing to the final elegant expression $\frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$.

I'm now considering the constraints on the parameters, specifically focusing on the conditions required for the square root operation to yield real values.

The key requirement is that $a_2$ and $a_3$ must share the same sign - either both positive or both negative - and neither can be zero. This ensures the square root $\sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$ remains real.

When $a_3$ is negative, calculating $a_3^{5/2}$ becomes complex. This raises important considerations about the nature of the coefficients and potential limitations in the nondimensionalization process.

The problem's goal seems to transform the expression into a standard form with specific constraints: $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, where $\epsilon$ is the only variable parameter. This suggests a systematic approach to parameter selection.

I'll focus on ensuring real coefficients through careful sign management and fractional power calculations, maintaining the integrity of the mathematical transformation.

When working with real coefficients, preserving reality requires strategic handling of signs and power relationships. The key considerations involve ensuring $a_2$ and $a_3$ share the same sign and carefully managing fractional power representations.

By systematically exploring different representations like $\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$ and $\epsilon = a_1 \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{5/2} a_2^{-1}$, I'm investigating the most stable and clear mathematical expression.

The algebraic manipulations reveal equivalent formulations, with subtle variations in coefficient arrangement. Ultimately, the initial form provides the most direct and comprehensible mathematical statement.

Looking at this problem, I need to find a transformation that converts the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the canonical form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

Let me use a substitution $x = \alpha y$ and scale the entire polynomial by a factor $\beta$:

$$\beta(a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3) = \beta a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + \beta a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + \beta a_3$$

$$= \beta a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + \beta a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + \beta a_3$$

For this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, I need the coefficients to match:

1) Constant term: $\beta a_3 = 1$
2) Coefficient of $y^2$: $\beta a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$  
3) Coefficient of $y^7$: $\beta a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$

From equation (1): $$\beta = \frac{1}{a_3}$$

Substituting into equation (2):
$$\frac{1}{a_3} \cdot a_2 \cdot \alpha^2 = 1$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$$

From equation (3):
$$\epsilon = \beta a_1 \alpha^7 = \frac{1}{a_3} \cdot a_1 \cdot \alpha^7$$

Since $\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$, we have:
$$\alpha^7 = (\alpha^2)^{7/2} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

Therefore:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

$$= \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{a_3^{7/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

$$= \frac{a_1 a_3^{7/2}}{a_3 a_2^{7/2}}$$

$$= \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

Therefore: $$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}}$$

Note: This transformation requires $a_2, a_3 \neq 0$ and that $\frac{a_3}{a_2} > 0$ for the result to be real-valued.
