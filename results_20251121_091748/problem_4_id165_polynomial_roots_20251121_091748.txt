QUESTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the polynomial\[P(x) =\epsilon x^{9} + x^{5} - 1.\] 
Find approximate expressions for all roots of the polynomials in the limit of small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$. Only a single term approximation to the root is required. 

REFERENCE SOLUTION:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Consider the problem to be of form $A+B+C=0$, with $A$, $B$, and $C$ corresponding to the three terms in $P(x)$ :$A=\epsilon x^{9};$ $B=x^{5};$ $C=-1.$
We now consider the three possible dominant balances, solving for the roots in each case and evaluating whether each balance holds for large or for small  $epsilon$.\vspace{1em}

We start with the balance $A+B=0$, assuming that $|C|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|B|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of  $epsilon$ then gives us 4 non-zero roots: 
  $epsilon x^{9} + x^{5}=0 $  $ \implies \boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.$ 
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|B|>>|C|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small  $epsilon$ is True and validity for large  $epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive  $epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Next we examine the balance $B+C=0$, assuming that $|A|$ is negligible when compared to $|B|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of  $epsilon$ gives us 5 non-zero roots:  $x^{5} - 1=0$  $ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ 1, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{4}, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}\right]}.$ 
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|B|,|C|>>|A|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small  $epsilon$ is True and validity for large  $epsilon$ is False.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of small positive  $epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

Finally, we examine the balance $A+C=0$, assuming that $|B|$ is negligible when compared to $|A|$ and $|C|$. Solving this for $x$ in terms of  $epsilon$ gives us 9 non-zero roots:   $epsilon x^{9} - 1=0$  $ \implies\boxed{ x=\left[ - \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  - \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]}.$ 
To verify the roots found for consistency with our initial assumption, we check that $|A|,|C|>>|B|$ holds for this root by substituting our found root expression for $x$ back into $A$, $B$, and $C$ and comparing their magnitudes. Using this method, we find that validity for small  $epsilon$ is False and validity for large  $epsilon$ is True.

\underline{Therefore, these roots are valid in the limit of large positive  $epsilon$ only.}\vspace{1em}

We expect that, in each  $epsilon$ regime, we have the same number of roots as the degree of the polynomial $P(x)$. We have found a total of 18 roots, half of which are valid in the limit of small positive  $epsilon$ and the other half of which are valid in the limit of large positive  $epsilon$. This is expected given the degree of the polynomial. So, the roots of $P(x)$ for large positive  $epsilon$ are $ \boxed{ \left[ - \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  - \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{i \pi}{9}}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{- \frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} e^{\frac{2 i \pi}{9}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} - i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \left(\sin{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)} + i \cos{\left(\frac{\pi}{18} \right)}\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \frac{\left(-1 - \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \frac{\left(-1 + \sqrt{3} i\right) \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}}{2}, \  \sqrt[9]{\frac{1}{\epsilon}}\right]} $ and the roots of $P(x)$ for small positive  $epsilon$ are $ \boxed{ \left[ - \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  1, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{4}, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}\right]} $ 

EXPECTED ANSWER:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
\left[ - \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  - i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  i \sqrt[4]{- \frac{1}{\epsilon}}, \  1, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{2 \sqrt{5} + 10}}{4}, \  - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} - \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}, \  - \frac{\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{1}{4} + \frac{i \sqrt{10 - 2 \sqrt{5}}}{4}\right]

We have the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$.

Let's consider the two limits:

1. Small positive $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \to 0^+$)
2. Large positive $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \to +\infty$)

For small $\epsilon$:
When $\epsilon$ is very small, the dominant terms are $x^5 - 1$. So we're essentially solving $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which gives us $x^5 = 1$. The roots are the 5th roots of unity: $x_k = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

But wait, we need to be more careful. We have $\epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1 = 0$. If $\epsilon$ is small, then we can treat this as a perturbation of $x^5 - 1 = 0$.

Let's write $x = x_0 + \epsilon x_1 + O(\epsilon^2)$ where $x_0$ is a root of $x^5 - 1 = 0$.

Substituting: $\epsilon (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^9 + (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^5 - 1 = 0$

To first order in $\epsilon$:
$\epsilon x_0^9 + x_0^5 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 - 1 = 0$

Since $x_0^5 = 1$:
$\epsilon x_0^9 + 1 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 - 1 = 0$


$\epsilon x_0^9 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 = 0$

I derive the correction term by solving for $x_1$. By manipulating the equation, I find $x_1 = -\frac{1}{5}$. This means the roots are slightly shifted from the original 5th roots of unity, with each root approximately $e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

When $\epsilon$ becomes very large, the equation's behavior changes dramatically. I now focus on the dominant terms $\epsilon x^9 - 1$, which effectively transforms the problem into solving $x^9 = \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This yields roots of $x_k = \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8$.

I carefully reconsider the full equation $\epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1 = 0$, rearranging to $x^9 + \frac{x^5}{\epsilon} - \frac{1}{\epsilon} = 0$. By assuming $x$ scales as $O(\epsilon^{-1/9})$, I can further analyze the root structure.

The $x^5$ term becomes negligibly small, scaling as $O(\epsilon^{-5/9})$ and contributing $\frac{x^5}{\epsilon} = O(\epsilon^{-14/9})$. This is significantly smaller than the primary terms $x^9$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ for large $\epsilon$.

Consequently, the leading-order approximation simplifies to $x^9 \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon}$, producing roots $x_k \approx \epsilon^{-1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 8$.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Looking at the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$, I'll find the approximate roots in both limiting cases.

## Case 1: Small positive $\epsilon$ (perturbation analysis)

When $\epsilon$ is small, the polynomial is dominated by the terms $x^5 - 1$. I'll treat the $\epsilon x^9$ term as a small perturbation.

The unperturbed equation $x^5 - 1 = 0$ has roots that are the 5th roots of unity:
$$x_k^{(0)} = e^{2\pi i k/5}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$$

To find the first-order correction, I assume $x = x_k^{(0)} + \epsilon \delta x_k + O(\epsilon^2)$ and substitute into the original equation:

$$\epsilon(x_k^{(0)} + \epsilon \delta x_k)^9 + (x_k^{(0)} + \epsilon \delta x_k)^5 - 1 = 0$$

Expanding to first order in $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon (x_k^{(0)})^9 + (x_k^{(0)})^5 + 5\epsilon (x_k^{(0)})^4 \delta x_k - 1 = 0$$

Since $(x_k^{(0)})^5 = 1$:
$$\epsilon (x_k^{(0)})^9 + 5\epsilon (x_k^{(0)})^4 \delta x_k = 0$$

Solving for $\delta x_k$:
$$\delta x_k = -\frac{(x_k^{(0)})^9}{5(x_k^{(0)})^4} = -\frac{(x_k^{(0)})^5}{5} = -\frac{1}{5}$$

Therefore, for small $\epsilon$:
$$\boxed{x_k \approx e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4}$$

## Case 2: Large positive $\epsilon$

When $\epsilon$ is large, the $\epsilon x^9$ term dominates. The polynomial becomes approximately:
$$\epsilon x^9 - 1 \approx 0$$

This gives:
$$x^9 \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$

The 9 roots are the 9th roots of $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$:
$$\boxed{x_k \approx \epsilon^{-1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}, \quad k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}$$

## Summary

- **Small $\epsilon$**: 5 roots approximately at $e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$
- **Large $\epsilon$**: 9 roots approximately at $\epsilon^{-1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}$

Note that as $\epsilon \to 0$, we lose 4 roots (they go to infinity), while as $\epsilon \to \infty$, we gain 4 additional roots that emerge from infinity.

I need to find the roots of $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1 = 0$ for small positive $\epsilon$ and large positive $\epsilon$.

This means I need to solve $\epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1 = 0$, or equivalently $\epsilon x^9 + x^5 = 1$.

Let me consider two cases:

**Case 1: Small positive $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \to 0^+$)**

When $\epsilon$ is very small, the term $\epsilon x^9$ becomes negligible compared to $x^5$ for most values of $x$. So the equation approximately becomes:
$x^5 \approx 1$

This gives us $x \approx 1^{1/5} = 1$ as the principal root.

But wait, let me be more careful. We have $x^5 = 1$, so the roots are the 5th roots of unity:
$x = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

These are:
- $x = 1$ (for $k = 0$)
- $x = e^{2\pi i/5}$
- $x = e^{4\pi i/5}$  
- $x = e^{6\pi i/5}$
- $x = e^{8\pi i/5}$

But I also need to consider if there might be other roots where $\epsilon x^9$ is not negligible. Let me think about this more systematically.

Actually, let me reconsider the structure. The polynomial is degree 9, so it should have 9 roots (counting multiplicities). When $\epsilon$ is small, 5 of these roots will be close to the 5th roots of unity, but what about the other 4?


When $x$ is large, $\epsilon x^9$ becomes significant. By rearranging the equation, I can see that $x$ will be approximately $(1/\epsilon)^{1/9}$. This suggests four additional roots that are much larger in magnitude compared to the 5th roots of unity. These large roots will depend critically on how small $\epsilon$ becomes, indicating a complex root structure that changes with $\epsilon$.

However, this initial analysis reveals an inconsistency. When I calculate $x^5$ and $\epsilon x^9$ for these large roots, the values don't align with my original assumptions. The $x^5$ term actually dominates, contradicting my initial reasoning about $\epsilon x^9$ being the primary term.

By substituting $x = \epsilon^{-\alpha} y$ with $y$ being of order 1, I can see a more nuanced balance emerging between the $\epsilon^{1-9\alpha} y^9$ and $\epsilon^{-5\alpha} y^5$ terms. The goal is to find conditions where these terms can cancel each other out while keeping the equation balanced.

When $\alpha$ is greater than 1/4, the $\epsilon^{-5\alpha} y^5$ term dominates, leading to $y^5 = \epsilon^{5\alpha}$. This results in $y = \epsilon^\alpha$ and ultimately $x = 1$, which contradicts the assumption of $x$ being large.

If $\alpha$ is less than 1/4, the $\epsilon^{1-9\alpha} y^9$ term becomes dominant, suggesting $y^9 = \epsilon^{9\alpha-1}$, which implies $y = \epsilon^{(\alpha-1/9)}$. This requires $\alpha \geq 1/9$ for $y$ to remain finite. Consequently, $x$ evaluates to $\epsilon^{-1/9}$.

An alternative strategy involves balancing terms differently. By assuming $\epsilon x^9 \sim x^5$, we derive $x^4 \sim 1/\epsilon$, leading to $x \sim \epsilon^{-1/4}$. This approach suggests exploring how $x^5$ and $\epsilon x^9$ scale with $\epsilon$.

The polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$ contains 9 roots in $\mathbb{C}$. For small positive $\epsilon$, we can view this as a slight modification of the standard $x^5 = 1$ equation, hinting at potential root behaviors near $\epsilon^{-1/4}$.

The 5 roots near the 5th roots of unity remain relatively stable, while 4 additional roots will drift toward infinity as $\epsilon$ approaches zero. By substituting $x = u/\epsilon^{1/4}$, we can explore the asymptotic behavior of these distant roots, revealing a scaled transformation that simplifies the polynomial's structure.

Analyzing the leading approximation shows two distinct root categories: a 5-fold root where $u^5 = 0$, and 4 simple roots satisfying $u^4 = -1$. These 4 roots correspond to specific complex values at $\pi/4$ intervals, representing a symmetric distribution around the unit circle.

The large roots scale inversely with $\epsilon^{1/4}$, positioned at four angular positions: $e^{i\pi/4}, e^{3i\pi/4}, e^{5i\pi/4}, e^{7i\pi/4}$. Complementing these, five additional finite roots emerge as the standard 5th roots of unity, evenly spaced across the complex plane.

The analysis suggests a nuanced root structure dependent on the parameter $\epsilon$, with distinct behaviors for the large and small roots.

When $\epsilon$ becomes substantial, the $\epsilon x^9$ term governs root behavior. This implies roots clustering near $(1/\epsilon)^{1/9}$, distributed across nine angular positions defined by $e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0$ to $8$.

Looking at the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$, I need to find the roots in two limiting cases. Since this is a degree-9 polynomial, there are exactly 9 roots.

## Case 1: Small positive $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \to 0^+$)

When $\epsilon$ is small, I can treat this as a perturbation of the equation $x^5 - 1 = 0$.

**Five finite roots:** These stay close to the roots of $x^5 = 1$, which are the 5th roots of unity:
$$x \approx e^{2\pi i k/5} \quad \text{for } k = 0,1,2,3,4$$

**Four roots that go to infinity:** For large $|x|$, the terms $\epsilon x^9$ and $x^5$ become comparable when $\epsilon x^9 \sim x^5$, which gives $x^4 \sim 1/\epsilon$, or $x \sim \epsilon^{-1/4}$.

Let me substitute $x = u/\epsilon^{1/4}$ into the original equation:
$$\epsilon \left(\frac{u}{\epsilon^{1/4}}\right)^9 + \left(\frac{u}{\epsilon^{1/4}}\right)^5 - 1 = 0$$

This gives:
$$\epsilon^{-5/4}(u^9 + u^5) - 1 = 0$$

For small $\epsilon$, the dominant balance is $u^9 + u^5 \approx 0$, which factors as:
$$u^5(u^4 + 1) = 0$$

This gives $u^4 = -1$ (ignoring the $u^5 = 0$ solutions which correspond to the finite roots). The solutions are:
$$u = e^{i\pi(2j+1)/4} \quad \text{for } j = 0,1,2,3$$

Therefore, the four large roots are:
$$x \approx \frac{e^{i\pi(2j+1)/4}}{\epsilon^{1/4}} \quad \text{for } j = 0,1,2,3$$

## Case 2: Large positive $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \to +\infty$)

When $\epsilon$ is large, the $\epsilon x^9$ term dominates, so the equation becomes approximately:
$$\epsilon x^9 \approx 1$$

This gives $x^9 \approx 1/\epsilon$, so:
$$x \approx \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/9}$$

The 9 roots of $x^9 = 1/\epsilon$ are:
$$x \approx \frac{e^{2\pi i k/9}}{\epsilon^{1/9}} \quad \text{for } k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8$$

## Summary

**Small $\epsilon$:**
- 5 finite roots: $x \approx e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3,4$
- 4 large roots: $x \approx \frac{e^{i\pi(2j+1)/4}}{\epsilon^{1/4}}$ for $j = 0,1,2,3$

**Large $\epsilon$:**
- All 9 roots: $x \approx \frac{e^{2\pi i k/9}}{\epsilon^{1/9}}$ for $k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8$

[Thinking block 1]
We have the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$.

Let's first consider the case of small positive $\epsilon$.

When $\epsilon$ is small, the dominant terms are $x^5 - 1$. So we expect the roots to be close to the roots of $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which are the 5th roots of unity: $x = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

But wait, let me be more careful. We want to find the roots of $\epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1 = 0$.

For small $\epsilon$, we can use perturbation theory. Let's write $x = x_0 + \epsilon x_1 + O(\epsilon^2)$, where $x_0$ is a root of $x^5 - 1 = 0$.

We have $x_0^5 = 1$, so $x_0 = \omega^k$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/5}$ and $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

Substituting into the equation:
$\epsilon (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^9 + (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^5 - 1 = 0$

Expanding to first order in $\epsilon$:
$\epsilon x_0^9 + (x_0^5 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1) - 1 = 0$

Since $x_0^5 = 1$:
$\epsilon x_0^9 + 1 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 - 1 = 0$


$\epsilon x_0^9 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 = 0$

Solving for $x_1$, we find it equals $-\frac{1}{5}$ for all roots. This means the roots are shifted slightly from the original 5th roots of unity.

Specifically, the roots will be approximately $\omega^k - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$, providing a precise approximation for small $\epsilon$.

I'm carefully checking the algebraic manipulations to confirm the exact relationship between $x_0$ and $x_1$ under the constraint $\omega^5 = 1$.

The first-order correction is consistent across all roots, yielding $x_1 = -\frac{1}{5}$. This means for small $\epsilon$, each root can be approximated as $x \approx \omega^k - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$, where $k$ ranges from 0 to 4.

Shifting focus to large $\epsilon$ values, the $\epsilon x^9$ term dominates the equation. This suggests the polynomial behaves as $\epsilon x^9 \approx 1$, implying $x^9$ is approximately $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

The roots emerge as $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k$ spanning 0 to 8. By dividing the equation by $\epsilon$, we confirm that for substantial $\epsilon$, the $\frac{x^5}{\epsilon}$ and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$ terms become negligible, validating our approximation.

Substituting the proposed root form reveals an interesting pattern: $x^9$ reduces to $\epsilon^{-1}$ and $x^5$ transforms to $\epsilon^{-5/9}$ with a complex rotation. This suggests a systematic approach to identifying which roots genuinely satisfy the equation.

For large $\epsilon$, the $\epsilon^{-5/9}$ term becomes negligibly small, effectively confirming our initial approximation. The roots cluster around $\epsilon^{-1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for nine distinct complex angles.

The polynomial's degree implies nine total roots, with an anticipated split: five roots near the fifth roots of unity, and four roots exhibiting different asymptotic behavior as $\epsilon$ varies. This nuanced root distribution hints at the equation's intricate structure under different scaling conditions.

By rewriting the equation as $x^5 = 1 - \epsilon x^9$, we reveal a delicate perturbation of the original system. For small $\epsilon$, roots near unity emerge naturally, suggesting a smooth deformation of the fundamental fifth roots.

The critical question remains: how do the remaining four roots behave when $x$ becomes large?

If $x$ grows significantly, $\epsilon x^9$ could dominate, leading to an approximate relationship where $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/9} \zeta^k$. This suggests a systematic way to track the additional roots by carefully balancing the scaling of $\epsilon$ and $x$.

The consistency of this approach hinges on ensuring $\epsilon^{-1/9}$ remains large while maintaining the condition that $\epsilon x^9$ substantially exceeds $x^5$.

I'll investigate roots by parameterizing $x$ as $\epsilon^a \xi$, where $a$ represents a scaling power and $\xi$ remains near unity. This method allows a more structured exploration of potential solution behaviors.

By substituting this form, I can derive a constraint equation that reveals how different powers of $\epsilon$ interact with the root's structure.

Examining three potential scenarios, I find the most promising emerges when the $\epsilon^{5a} \xi^5$ term becomes dominant. This occurs precisely when $a = 0$, yielding $\xi^5 = 1$ and generating five finite roots.

The other cases reveal interesting constraints: one scenario requires $a < -1/9$, which leads to an approximate value of $-1$, clearly incompatible with a zero solution. The final scenario suggests $1 + 9a = 0$, hinting at another potential root configuration.

Investigating the $a = -1/9$ case reveals subtle interactions between different terms as $\epsilon$ approaches zero, with some roots potentially diverging while others remain finite. This complexity suggests a nuanced approach is necessary to fully understand the root behavior.

Looking at the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$, I'll find the approximate roots in both limits.

## Small positive $\epsilon$ limit

When $\epsilon$ is small, I'll use perturbation theory. Let me write $x = x_0 + \epsilon x_1 + O(\epsilon^2)$ where $x_0$ satisfies the unperturbed equation.

**Case 1: Finite roots**
For the unperturbed equation $x^5 - 1 = 0$, we have $x_0 = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3,4$.

Substituting the perturbation expansion:
$$\epsilon(x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^9 + (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^5 - 1 = 0$$

Expanding to first order in $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon x_0^9 + (x_0^5 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1) - 1 = 0$$

Since $x_0^5 = 1$:
$$\epsilon x_0^9 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 = 0$$
$$x_1 = -\frac{x_0^5}{5} = -\frac{1}{5}$$

**Case 2: Large roots**
For roots that become large as $\epsilon \to 0$, let $x = \epsilon^{-1/9}\xi$ where $\xi$ is $O(1)$.

Substituting:
$$\epsilon \cdot \epsilon^{-1}\xi^9 + \epsilon^{-5/9}\xi^5 - 1 = 0$$
$$\xi^9 + \epsilon^{4/9}\xi^5 - \epsilon = 0$$

As $\epsilon \to 0$: $\xi^9 = 0$, which gives $\xi = 0$. This suggests we need a different scaling.

Let me try $x = \epsilon^{-1/4}\xi$:
$$\epsilon \cdot \epsilon^{-9/4}\xi^9 + \epsilon^{-5/4}\xi^5 - 1 = 0$$
$$\epsilon^{-5/4}\xi^9 + \epsilon^{-5/4}\xi^5 - 1 = 0$$

This gives: $\xi^9 + \xi^5 = \epsilon^{5/4}$

As $\epsilon \to 0$: $\xi^5(\xi^4 + 1) = 0$, so either $\xi = 0$ or $\xi^4 = -1$.

The solutions $\xi^4 = -1$ give $\xi = e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3$.

**Small $\epsilon$ result:**
- 5 finite roots: $x \approx e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3,4$
- 4 large roots: $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/4}e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3$

## Large positive $\epsilon$ limit

When $\epsilon$ is large, the $\epsilon x^9$ term dominates. The equation becomes approximately:
$$\epsilon x^9 \approx 1$$
$$x^9 \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$

Therefore: $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/9}e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8$

To verify this is consistent, substitute back:
$$\epsilon(\epsilon^{-1/9}e^{2\pi i k/9})^9 + (\epsilon^{-1/9}e^{2\pi i k/9})^5 - 1$$
$$= 1 + \epsilon^{-5/9}e^{10\pi i k/9} - 1 = \epsilon^{-5/9}e^{10\pi i k/9}$$

For large $\epsilon$, this is indeed small, confirming our approximation.

**Large $\epsilon$ result:**
- 9 roots: $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/9}e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8$

## Summary

**Small $\epsilon > 0$:**
- $x \approx e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$ (5 roots, $k = 0,1,2,3,4$)
- $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/4}e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4}$ (4 roots, $k = 0,1,2,3$)

**Large $\epsilon > 0$:**
- $x \approx \epsilon^{-1/9}e^{2\pi i k/9}$ (9 roots, $k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8$)

----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thinking block 1]
We have the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$.

Let's consider the two cases:

**Case 1: Small positive $\epsilon$**

When $\epsilon$ is small, we can think of this as a perturbation of $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which has roots that are the 5th roots of unity.

The unperturbed equation is $x^5 - 1 = 0$, which has roots:
$x_k = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$.

So the roots are:
- $x_0 = 1$
- $x_1 = e^{2\pi i/5}$
- $x_2 = e^{4\pi i/5}$
- $x_3 = e^{6\pi i/5} = e^{-4\pi i/5}$
- $x_4 = e^{8\pi i/5} = e^{-2\pi i/5}$

Now, when we add the small perturbation $\epsilon x^9$, we can use perturbation theory. If $x = x_0 + \epsilon x_1 + O(\epsilon^2)$, then:

$P(x) = \epsilon (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^9 + (x_0 + \epsilon x_1)^5 - 1$

To first order in $\epsilon$:
$P(x) \approx \epsilon x_0^9 + x_0^5 + 5\epsilon x_0^4 x_1 - 1$

Since $x_0$ is a root of $x^5 - 1 = 0$, we have $x_0^5 = 1$, so:


$x_1 = -\frac{x_0^5}{5} = -\frac{1}{5}$

This means the first-order correction to the root $x_0 = 1$ is a small negative value of $-\frac{1}{5}$. The perturbation shifts the root slightly to the left on the real axis.

For the 5th roots of unity, each root is displaced by approximately $-\frac{\epsilon}{5}$, creating a systematic shift in the complex plane. The roots maintain their original angular positions but move closer to the origin.

The 9th degree polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$ suggests a more complex root structure. While five roots cluster near the original 5th roots of unity, the additional four roots require further investigation to understand their precise locations and behavior under small perturbation.

Examining the roots close to the 5th roots of unity, we can approximate them as $x \approx \omega_k - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$, where $\omega_k = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4$. These roots represent a slight displacement from the standard 5th roots of unity.

For the remaining four roots, we'll explore their characteristics when $\epsilon$ is small and $|x|$ is large. By assuming $x^5 - 1 \approx x^5$, we can begin to characterize their asymptotic behavior through the approximate equation $x^5(\epsilon x^4 + 1)$.

Solving this reveals $x^4 \approx -\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, indicating roots with magnitude around $\epsilon^{-1/4}$. More precisely, these roots can be expressed as $x = \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.

This yields four specific approximations:
- $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{i\pi/4}$
- $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{3i\pi/4}$
- $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{5i\pi/4}$
- $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{7i\pi/4}$

**Case 2: Large positive $\epsilon$**

When $\epsilon$ becomes large, the $\epsilon x^9$ term dominates, leading to the approximation $x^9 \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon}$. This suggests $x$ approaches $\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/9}$. The precise relationship involves $x^9 = \frac{1}{\epsilon}$

, resulting in nine roots: $x = \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{1/9} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 8$.

These roots can be approximated as $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/9}} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ across the specified range.

I'll investigate the small $\epsilon$ scenario by examining roots near the 5th roots of unity, parameterizing $x$ as $\omega + \epsilon y$ where $\omega^5 = 1$.

Expanding and simplifying the polynomial to first order reveals $y = -\frac{1}{5}$, which means $x \approx \omega - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$.

For large roots where $|x| \gg 1$, I find $x^4 = -\frac{1}{\epsilon}$, yielding $x = \epsilon^{-1/4} e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4}$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$.

These complex roots represent the asymptotic behavior of the system near the critical point, capturing the nonlinear dynamics through their specific angular and magnitude characteristics.

Looking at the polynomial $P(x) = \epsilon x^9 + x^5 - 1$, I need to find approximate expressions for the roots in two limits.

## Case 1: Small positive $\epsilon$

When $\epsilon$ is small, I can treat this as a perturbation of $x^5 - 1 = 0$. This suggests two types of roots:

**Type A: Roots near the 5th roots of unity**

The unperturbed equation $x^5 - 1 = 0$ has roots $\omega_k = e^{2\pi i k/5}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3,4$.

Using perturbation theory, let $x = \omega_k + \epsilon y$. Substituting into $P(x) = 0$:
$$\epsilon(\omega_k + \epsilon y)^9 + (\omega_k + \epsilon y)^5 - 1 = 0$$

Expanding to first order in $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon\omega_k^9 + \omega_k^5 + 5\epsilon\omega_k^4 y - 1 = 0$$

Since $\omega_k^5 = 1$, this becomes:
$$\epsilon\omega_k^9 + 5\epsilon\omega_k^4 y = 0$$

Since $\omega_k^5 = 1$, we have $\omega_k^9 = \omega_k^4$, so:
$$y = -\frac{1}{5}$$

Therefore: $$x \approx \omega_k - \frac{\epsilon}{5} = e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5} \quad (k = 0,1,2,3,4)$$

**Type B: Large roots**

For large $|x|$, the constant term $-1$ becomes negligible compared to $x^5$, giving:
$$\epsilon x^9 + x^5 \approx 0$$
$$x^4 = -\frac{1}{\epsilon}$$

Therefore: $$x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4} \quad (k = 0,1,2,3)$$

## Case 2: Large positive $\epsilon$

When $\epsilon$ is large, the $\epsilon x^9$ term dominates, so:
$$\epsilon x^9 - 1 \approx 0$$
$$x^9 = \frac{1}{\epsilon}$$

Therefore: $$x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/9}} e^{2\pi i k/9} \quad (k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8)$$

## Summary

**Small $\epsilon$ limit:**
- 5 roots: $x \approx e^{2\pi i k/5} - \frac{\epsilon}{5}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3,4$
- 4 roots: $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/4}} e^{i\pi(2k+1)/4}$ for $k = 0,1,2,3$

**Large $\epsilon$ limit:**
- 9 roots: $x \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon^{1/9}} e^{2\pi i k/9}$ for $k = 0,1,2,\ldots,8$
