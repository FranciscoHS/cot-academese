Let me solve these problems step by step.

PROBLEM 1:
I need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. Note that $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$  
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Grouping by powers of $\omega$:
$P(\omega) = (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2$
 
When $P(\omega^2)$ is evaluated, the coefficients rearrange in a similar pattern, creating symmetric conditions. The key requirement is that three specific sums of coefficients must equal zero. This means the coefficients are constrained to form balanced groups across the 9-tuple, with each group summing to zero.

For three variables taking values $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ and constrained to sum to zero, there are precisely 7 valid arrangements. Since three independent equations apply these constraints, the total number of valid configurations becomes $7^3 = 343$ distinct possibilities.

The problem then shifts to exploring the least common multiple relationship between $2n$, $n^2$, and $62n - 336$, seeking positive integer solutions where specific multiplicative conditions are met.

[Thinking block 1]
Let me solve each problem one by one.

PROBLEM 1:
We need the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity: $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.

For the polynomial to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, it must be zero at both $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

Let $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$, so $\omega^8 = \omega^2$, $\omega^7 = \omega$, $\omega^6 = 1$, $\omega^5 = \omega^2$, $\omega^4 = \omega$, $\omega^3 = 1$.

So $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$.

This gives us $(a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0) = 0$.
 
When $P(\omega^2)$ is evaluated, we get a similar equation with coefficients rearranged. The linear independence of $\{1, \omega, \omega^2\}$ implies three key constraints on the coefficients. These constraints will determine the relationships between the polynomial's coefficients to ensure divisibility by $x^2 + x + 1$.

For the first equation $a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$, we systematically explore possible combinations. The solutions involve specific arrangements of -1, 0, and 1, with multiple valid configurations. By carefully counting permutations where the sum equals zero, we find 7 distinct solution sets that satisfy the constraint.

The analysis requires precise tracking of coefficient combinations, ensuring each potential solution meets the strict requirements of the polynomial's structure.

Extending this to three independent constraints with 6 free variables introduces complexity. Initially, the calculation suggests $7^3 \cdot 3^6$ as a potential solution, but this seems too large for the expected answer range.

I recognize the need to carefully re-examine the computational approach, sensing an error in the initial reasoning that requires a more nuanced investigation.

The key insight emerges: while 6 variables can be chosen freely, not every selection will satisfy the three constraints. The relationship between the free and constrained variables is more intricate than a simple multiplication would suggest.

The problem demands a deeper understanding of how the constraints interact with the variable selections, hinting at a more subtle counting method that isn't immediately apparent.

Each constraint equation requires the sum of three specific variables to equal zero, with 7 potential solutions per equation. This suggests a systematic approach to exploring valid configurations.

Investigating the least common multiple (LCM) of $2n$ and $n^2$ reveals two distinct scenarios based on $n$'s divisibility by 2. When $n$ is odd, the LCM calculation yields $2n^2$, while an even $n$ results in $n^2$.

The resulting quadratic equations differ subtly: an odd $n$ produces $n^2 - 31n + 168 = 0$, and an even $n$ generates $n^2 - 62n + 336 = 0$. These equations set the stage for determining potential integer solutions through careful algebraic manipulation.

The next step involves solving these quadratic expressions, with the discriminant playing a crucial role in identifying valid integer values for $n$.
