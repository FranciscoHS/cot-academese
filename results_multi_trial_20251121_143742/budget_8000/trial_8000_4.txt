Let's call the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

This means if $\omega$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$, then $P(\omega) = 0$.

The polynomial $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ has roots that are the primitive cube roots of unity.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, which means $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$.

The two primitive cube roots of unity are $\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Let me compute $P(\omega)$:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$


- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

Substituting these values, $P(\omega)$ simplifies to:
$= (a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0)$

To solve $P(\omega) = 0$, I'll examine two key equations. The first equation requires the quadratic in $\omega$ to equal zero, which means finding roots where the coefficients vanish. 

When $P(\omega^2) = 0$, the equation transforms due to $\omega^4 = \omega$, creating an interesting constraint where the coefficients must satisfy a specific relationship. The substitution reveals a complex interdependence among the coefficients $a_8$ through $a_0$, suggesting a structured system of linear constraints.

By introducing variables $A$, $B$, and $C$ representing grouped coefficients, I can simplify the analysis. Subtracting the transformed equations reveals that $A$ must equal $B$, and further manipulation shows $A$ must also equal $C$. 

This means the coefficients must have a symmetric arrangement, with $a_8 + a_5 + a_2$ equaling $a_7 + a_4 + a_1$ and both equaling $a_6 + a_3 + a_0$.

I'll explore the possible values for this common sum $k$, considering that each coefficient can only be $-1$, $0$, or $1$. The combinations reveal different scenarios for how these coefficients might be distributed to maintain the equality constraint.

The possible values of $k$ range from $-3$ to $-1$, depending on the specific arrangement of $-1$, $0$, and $1$ within each grouped sum.

By systematically examining the combinations, I see the sum can take on values like $0$ and $1$ when mixing different coefficient values. The key observation is that the sum is bounded between $-3$ and $3$, with discrete integer steps reflecting the limited coefficient options.

Critically, each unique combination of $-1$, $0$, and $1$ produces a distinct sum, creating a structured set of possible values for $k$ that captures the mathematical constraints of the problem.

I'll need to count the precise number of ways to achieve each sum $k$ across different index sets, focusing on the combinatorial possibilities of selecting $(-1, 0, 1)$ for each group of three indices.

For $k = -3$, there's only one straightforward way: selecting $(-1, -1, -1)$ across the relevant index groups.

For $k = -2$, I'll count the permutations of $(-1, -1, 0)$ across the index groups, which yields multiple arrangements.

For $k = -1$, I find two distinct configurations:
- $(-1, -1, 1)$ with 3 permutational ways
- $(-1, 0, 0)$ also with 3 permutational ways
Totaling 6 distinct possibilities.

For $k = 0$, I observe:
- $(-1, 0, 1)$ generating 6 permutational arrangements
- $(0, 0, 0)$ representing a single unique configuration
Resulting in 7 total ways.

For $k = 1$, I identify:
- $(0, 0, 1)$ with 3 permutational ways
- $(-1, 1, 1)$ also with 3 permutational ways
Summing to 6 total possibilities.

For $k = 2$, $(0, 1, 1)$ provides 3 permutational arrangements.

For $k = 3$, the sole configuration is $(1, 1, 1)$.

I calculate the total valid 9-tuples by cubing each count and summing:
$1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 = 831$

I verify the counts systematically:
- For $k = 0$, I find 7 ways: $(-1, 0, 1)$ arrangements and $(0, 0, 0)$
- For $k = -1$, I confirm 6 ways: $(-1, -1, 1)$ and $(-1, 0, 0)$ arrangements
- I'm now checking the count for $k = 1$, examining combinations that sum to 1

The systematic verification ensures my initial calculation's accuracy, methodically confirming each sum's possible arrangements.

I sum the cubes of the arrangement counts: $1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 = 831$, which represents the total number of unique three-number combinations from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ across different sum constraints.
