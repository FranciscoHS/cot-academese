We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Since $x^2 + x + 1$ has roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$, $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$.

Let me compute the powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So we have:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$

Grouping by powers of $\omega$:
$P(\omega) = (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$


$P(\omega^2)$ requires careful computation of powers using $\omega^2 = (-\omega - 1)$ and $\omega^3 = 1$.

I'll track the cyclic pattern of $\omega^2$ powers:
- $1$ repeats at exponents divisible by 3
- $\omega$ appears at certain exponents
- $\omega^2$ emerges in a predictable sequence

This pattern will simplify the polynomial computation by reducing complex exponents to simpler terms.

Grouping the coefficients reveals a structured approach:
- First group combines $a_0, a_3, a_6$
- Second group combines $a_2, a_5, a_8$
- Third group combines $a_1, a_4, a_7$

By setting $P(\omega)$ and $P(\omega^2)$ to zero, we create a system of constraints that will help determine the coefficients systematically.

The cyclic nature of $\omega^2$ suggests these equations will provide key insights into the polynomial's structure.

Since $1, \omega, \omega^2$ form a basis over $\mathbb{R}$, each group must independently sum to zero. This means we'll need to explore combinations where the coefficients balance each other out.

The constraints require each group of three coefficients to sum to zero, with each coefficient limited to $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. This sets up an intriguing combinatorial problem of finding valid coefficient arrangements.

I'll systematically count valid configurations. First, the trivial case of all zeros is clearly one solution. Then, more interesting arrangements emerge where positive and negative values offset each other.

For the first constraint group, I see multiple possible arrangements. One involves placing a zero alongside a positive and negative value that cancel out. The permutations of these arrangements will be key to determining the total number of solutions.

The challenge lies in finding all unique ways three values from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ can sum precisely to zero, considering their order matters.

By carefully tracking each possible combination, I've identified three distinct valid configurations where the sum equals zero: $(-1, 0, 1)$ in various permutations, $(0, -1, 1)$ in its arrangements, and the all-zero case.

These solutions represent the complete set of ways to satisfy the constraint, ensuring each selected value balances the others to create a zero sum.

The systematic approach revealed 7 unique triples that meet the mathematical requirement, demonstrating the precise conditions needed for this specific constraint.

By applying these independent constraints across three different coordinate sets, I calculate the total possible combinations as 7 cubed, which equals 343 distinct 9-tuples. Each coordinate set offers 7 potential configurations, and their independence allows straightforward multiplication to determine the total number of valid arrangements.

Looking at this problem, I need to find when $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Since $x^2 + x + 1$ has roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity, I need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, the powers of $\omega$ cycle: $\omega^0 = 1, \omega^1 = \omega, \omega^2 = \omega^2, \omega^3 = 1, \omega^4 = \omega, \omega^5 = \omega^2, \omega^6 = 1, \omega^7 = \omega, \omega^8 = \omega^2$.

So $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Grouping by powers: $P(\omega) = (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$

Similarly, for $\omega^2$, the powers cycle as: $(\omega^2)^0 = 1, (\omega^2)^1 = \omega^2, (\omega^2)^2 = \omega, (\omega^2)^3 = 1, (\omega^2)^4 = \omega^2, (\omega^2)^5 = \omega, (\omega^2)^6 = 1, (\omega^2)^7 = \omega^2, (\omega^2)^8 = \omega$.

So $P(\omega^2) = (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega^2 = 0$

Since $\{1, \omega, \omega^2\}$ are linearly independent over $\mathbb{R}$, both conditions give us:
- $a_0 + a_3 + a_6 = 0$
- $a_1 + a_4 + a_7 = 0$
- $a_2 + a_5 + a_8 = 0$

For each constraint of the form $x + y + z = 0$ where $x, y, z \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, I need to count solutions.

Checking systematically, the valid triples $(x, y, z)$ summing to 0 are:
$(-1, 0, 1), (-1, 1, 0), (0, -1, 1), (0, 0, 0), (0, 1, -1), (1, -1, 0), (1, 0, -1)$

That's 7 solutions for each constraint.

Since the three constraints are independent, the total number is $7^3 = 343$.
