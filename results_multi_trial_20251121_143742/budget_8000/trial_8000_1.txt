Let's call the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let's find the roots of $x^2 + x + 1$. We use the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$

Let $\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$, $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So we need:
$a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1(\omega^2) + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
$\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^{2}$
$\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^{1} = \omega$
$\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$


$\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^{2}$
$\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^{1} = \omega$
$\omega^3 = 1$
$\omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^0 = 1$

I see a pattern of powers of $\omega$ repeating cyclically. When $\omega^2$ is raised to powers, it follows a similar cyclic behavior due to the fundamental property $(\omega^2)^3 = 1$.

Specifically, $(\omega^2)^8 = (\omega^2)^{2} = \omega$, and the subsequent powers continue this cyclic reduction. Each power of $(\omega^2)$ can be simplified by taking the modulo 3 of the exponent, resulting in a consistent pattern of $\omega$, $\omega^2$, and $1$.

This leads to a system of equations where coefficients $a_8$ through $a_0$ interact in a structured manner, creating a complex but predictable relationship based on the cyclic nature of $\omega$.

By leveraging the fundamental property $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, we discover that the coefficients in both equations satisfy identical conditions: each group of three coefficients (shifted by different indices) must sum to zero.

This symmetry suggests a deeper algebraic constraint governing the coefficients, implying a precise mathematical relationship that transcends simple linear dependencies.

The constraints require each coefficient to be selected from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, creating a structured yet restricted solution space. I'll systematically explore the possible combinations for the first equation, tracking the valid triples that satisfy the zero-sum requirement.

For the initial equation $a_0 + a_3 + a_6 = 0$, I'm identifying the unique triples where the elements are $-1$, $0$, or $1$ and collectively sum to zero. The first configurations emerge, revealing the intricate combinatorial challenge.

After careful enumeration, I confirm 7 distinct solutions exist: $(0, 0, 0)$, $(1, 0, -1)$, $(1, -1, 0)$, $(0, 1, -1)$, $(-1, 1, 0)$, $(-1, 0, 1)$, and $(0, -1, 1)$. This validates the systematic approach of checking all possible combinations against the zero-sum constraint.

I'll systematically verify each triple's sum, noting valid zero-sum configurations and tracking their mathematical properties. The comprehensive check ensures no potential solution is overlooked.

Key zero-sum triples emerge across different number combinations:
• $(-1, 0, 1)$ balances perfectly
• $(-1, 1, 0)$ demonstrates symmetric cancellation
• $(0, -1, 1)$ shows another elegant zero-sum arrangement

These three unique solutions represent all possible zero-sum combinations within the constrained set of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, highlighting the elegant mathematical symmetry inherent in this problem's solution space.

By systematically exploring each possible triple configuration, we discover 7 distinct solutions that satisfy the zero-sum condition. Extending this pattern across the entire 9-tuple structure yields $7^3 = 343$ total possible arrangements, revealing a fascinating combinatorial complexity emerging from simple numerical constraints.
