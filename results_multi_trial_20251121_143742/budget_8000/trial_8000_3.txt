We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

First, let me find the roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. Using the quadratic formula:
$x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$

Let $\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$ (since $\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity), and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So we need:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^3 = 1$


- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

Substituting these relations, $P(\omega)$ simplifies to a compact expression involving only $a_8, a_7, a_6, a_5, a_4, a_3, a_2, a_1,$ and $a_0$. This allows us to establish key constraints on the coefficients that ensure divisibility by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The conditions require each group of three coefficients to sum to zero, creating a systematic pattern of constraints across the polynomial's terms.

When evaluating $P(\omega^2)$, we leverage the cyclic properties of $\omega$, noting how powers of $\omega^2$ reduce to simpler forms due to the fundamental relations of the primitive cube root of unity.

By rearranging the polynomial and applying these cyclic transformations, we discover identical constraint equations that force specific relationships between the coefficients, ensuring the polynomial vanishes when evaluated at $\omega^2$.

These constraints demonstrate a deep symmetry in the polynomial's structure, revealing how the coefficients must be precisely balanced to satisfy the underlying algebraic conditions.

For the first constraint $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, we identify 7 distinct ways to select coefficients from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ that sum to zero. These combinations include six non-zero permutations and one trivial zero solution, showcasing the intricate ways these coefficients can interrelate while maintaining the required mathematical balance.

By applying similar reasoning to the other coefficient groups $(a_7, a_4, a_1)$ and $(a_6, a_3, a_0)$, we calculate the total number of possible 9-tuples as $7^3 = 343$, representing the independent combinations that satisfy our initial constraints.

However, I'm now carefully re-examining the specific combinations to verify the precise count of ways three coefficients can sum to zero.

I systematically list out all possible $(a, b, c)$ combinations where $a, b, c \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, marking those that result in a zero sum. The combinations include various permutations like $(-1, 0, 1)$, $(0, -1, 1)$, $(0, 0, 0)$, and $(1, -1, 0)$, each representing a valid solution where the three values balance to zero.

By counting these zero-sum combinations, I find 7 distinct arrangements. Applying the cube rule, I calculate $7^3 = 343$ as the total number of possible three-value combinations that satisfy the zero-sum condition.
