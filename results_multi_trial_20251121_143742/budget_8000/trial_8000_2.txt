[Thinking block 1]
We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the polynomial 
$$p(x) = a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$$
is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

First, let's understand what $x^2 + x + 1$ means. The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the complex cube roots of unity other than 1. Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$ and $\omega^3 = 1$. The roots are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

For $p(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $p(\omega) = 0$ and $p(\omega^2) = 0$.

Let's compute $p(\omega)$:
$$p(\omega) = a_8 \omega^8 + a_7 \omega^7 + a_6 \omega^6 + a_5 \omega^5 + a_4 \omega^4 + a_3 \omega^3 + a_2 \omega^2 + a_1 \omega + a_0$$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$


$$p(\omega) = a_8 \omega^2 + a_7 \omega + a_6 \cdot 1 + a_5 \omega^2 + a_4 \omega + a_3 \cdot 1 + a_2 \omega^2 + a_1 \omega + a_0$$
$$= a_0 + a_3 + a_6 + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7) \omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8) \omega^2$$

I rearrange the terms to group constants, $\omega$ terms, and $\omega^2$ terms. This simplifies the expression by collecting like powers of $\omega$.

For $p(\omega) = 0$, the equation requires each coefficient group to equal zero. This means:
- The constant terms must sum to zero
- The $\omega$ coefficients must sum to zero
- The $\omega^2$ coefficients must sum to zero

These conditions arise because $1, \omega, \omega^2$ are linearly independent, forcing each coefficient group to independently equal zero.

When evaluating $p(\omega^2)$, we observe similar constraints emerge. The substitution of $\omega^2$ leads to identical coefficient groupings, resulting in the same three fundamental conditions:
- $a_0 + a_3 + a_6 = 0$
- $a_1 + a_4 + a_7 = 0$
- $a_2 + a_5 + a_8 = 0$

These relationships suggest a symmetric structure in the polynomial's coefficients.

I'll systematically explore the solutions for each equation, focusing on combinations where $x, y, z \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and their sum equals zero.

The first observation reveals a critical constraint: when seeking combinations summing to zero, the possibilities become quite limited. With values restricted to $-1$, $0$, and $1$, the solution space narrows significantly.

I see three primary scenarios emerge:
- A single zero with balanced nonzero values
- All values being zero
- Precisely balanced nonzero values canceling each other

The combinations requiring one zero and two nonzero values demand perfect symmetry: one positive and one negative value. This creates six distinct permutations where the signs perfectly counterbalance.

When all values are nonzero, the constraints become even more stringent. Only two configurations satisfy the zero-sum requirement: either two negative and one positive, or two positive and one negative.

The systematic exploration reveals subtle constraints in these three-value combinations. Each scenario demands precise mathematical relationships to achieve equilibrium.

Calculating systematically shows the complexity increases exponentially when extending to multiple equations. The independent nature of each equation multiplies potential solutions dramatically.

I'm tracking valid combinations where the sum precisely equals zero, methodically checking each permutation of -1, 0, and 1. Some configurations immediately fail, while others perfectly balance.

The zero-sum requirement creates intricate patterns across different coordinate arrangements. Each valid solution represents a delicate mathematical harmony where positive and negative values neutralize each other.

I'll continue systematically exploring these coordinate triples, seeking those precise combinations that resolve to zero, carefully marking successful and unsuccessful attempts.

The valid triples expand to include:
1. $(-1, 0, 1)$
2. $(-1, 1, 0)$
3. $(0, -1, 1)$
4. $(0, 0, 0)$
5. $(0, 1, -1)$
6. $(1, -1, 0)$
7. $(1, 0, -1)$

By calculating each triple's sum and confirming they indeed equal zero, I've identified seven distinct solutions. Multiplying these solutions across three coordinate positions yields $7^3 = 343$ possible 9-tuples satisfying the constraint.
