Let me denote the polynomial as $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$. 

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$, $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$, and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$P(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
$\omega^8 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2 + 2} = (\omega^3)^2 \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^7 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2 + 1} = (\omega^3)^2 \cdot \omega = \omega$
$\omega^6 = (\omega^3)^2 = 1$


$\omega^5 = \omega^{3 + 2} = \omega^3 \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^4 = \omega^{3 + 1} = \omega^3 \cdot \omega = \omega$
$\omega^3 = 1$

Substituting these values, $P(\omega)$ simplifies to a compact expression involving the coefficients $a_8, a_7, \ldots, a_0$, revealing a symmetric relationship between the terms due to the properties of $\omega$.

Collecting like terms yields a zero-sum equation with grouped coefficients across different powers of $\omega$. This suggests a structured pattern in the polynomial's composition.

The subsequent calculations demonstrate similar exponential reduction patterns for $(\omega^2)^n$, showing consistent transformations based on the fundamental properties of $\omega$. Each power reveals a predictable simplification mechanism that relates to the underlying algebraic structure.

By defining aggregate coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ to represent grouped terms, we're preparing to establish a systematic relationship between the original polynomial's coefficients and their transformed representations.

Subtracting the two equations reveals a critical constraint: $(A - B)(\omega^2 - \omega) = 0$. Since $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity with $\omega^2 - \omega \neq 0$, this implies $A = B$.

Substituting this equality into the first equation, $A\omega^2 + A\omega + C = 0$, suggests a further structural relationship between the coefficients, specifically that $A(\omega^2 + \omega) + C = 0$. The subsequent algebraic manipulation will likely explore the implications of this constraint.

The key insight emerges: $A = B = C$, which fundamentally determines the symmetry of the coefficients. This symmetry translates to a balanced relationship among the sequence's terms, where specific grouped indices share an identical sum $k$.

Each term in the sequence is restricted to the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, setting up a constrained optimization problem where the grouped sums must satisfy specific conditions.

By systematically exploring possible values of $k$, I'm investigating the combinatorial possibilities. For $k = -3$, there's only one configuration: $(-1, -1, -1)$. As $k$ increases, the number of valid arrangements becomes more complex.

For $k = -2$, three distinct arrangements emerge by strategically placing two $-1$'s and one $0$. The progression reveals an intricate pattern of term combinations that satisfy the constraint.

The $k = -1$ case introduces more nuanced possibilities, with multiple ways to achieve the target sum through careful selection of $-1$'s, $0$'s, and $1$'s.

When $k = 0$, the arrangements become even more interesting, with both uniform $0$ configurations and mixed $-1$, $0$, $1$ combinations yielding valid solutions.

For positive $k$ values, the pattern continues, with increasing $1$'s and strategic placement determining the total number of valid arrangements.

The key insight emerges when multiplying the constraint solutions across different index sets, revealing the total number of ways to satisfy the complex summation conditions.

By cubing the count of ways to achieve each sum $k$ and summing across the range $-3$ to $3$, we discover a systematic approach to enumerating these intricate 9-tuple configurations.

The final calculation elegantly transforms the problem into a straightforward arithmetic progression: $1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 = 831$ total arrangements.
