A polynomial $f(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$ if and only if $f(\omega) = 0$ and $f(\omega^2) = 0$, where $\omega$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the complex cube roots of unity other than 1. We have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$. Also, $\omega^2$ is the other root.

So we need:
$f(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$f(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1(\omega^2) + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$


- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$

Substituting these power reductions, $f(\omega)$ simplifies to a compact form involving grouped terms with $\omega^2$ and $\omega$. The coefficients combine systematically, revealing a structured relationship between the polynomial's coefficients when evaluated at the complex cube roots of unity.

Similarly, $f(\omega^2)$ undergoes a parallel transformation, with exponents cyclically reducing based on modulo 3 arithmetic. The pattern shows how powers of $\omega^2$ systematically cycle through $\omega$, $\omega^2$, and 1, creating an elegant symmetry in the polynomial's evaluation.

Combining these results yields a structured polynomial representation: $(a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega^2 + (a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0)$. When setting $f(\omega) = 0$ and $f(\omega^2) = 0$, we generate two distinct but symmetrically related equations.

The key insight emerges from the linear independence of $\{1, \omega, \omega^2\}$ over $\mathbb{Q}$, which suggests a profound constraint on the coefficients' relationships.

I'll analyze the constraint $a + b + c = 0$ where $a, b, c \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$. Examining the possible combinations reveals five potential solution configurations, with four valid arrangements: $(1, 0, -1)$, $(1, -1, 0)$, $(0, 1, -1)$, and $(0, 0, 0)$. The $(1, 1, -2)$ combination is immediately disqualified due to the $-2$ value.

Continuing the exploration, I find additional valid solutions: $(0, -1, 1)$, $(-1, 1, 0)$, and $(-1, 0, 1)$. This brings the total valid solutions for each constraint to 7.

Given the independence of the three constraints, I calculate the total number of solutions by multiplying: $7^3 = 343$ distinct configurations satisfy the original system of equations.
