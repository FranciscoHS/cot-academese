We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Since $P(x)$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity satisfying $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$, and $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$.

Let's compute the powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$

So we have $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$.

Substituting $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$:


I rearrange the terms, grouping $\omega$ and constant coefficients together. The equation becomes a sum of two parts: one with $\omega$ and another without $\omega$. This allows me to set up conditions for the coefficients to make $P(\omega)$ equal to zero.

By equating the coefficients of $\omega$ and the constant terms, I derive two key relationships. These relationships connect the coefficients across different indices, revealing a symmetric pattern in the polynomial's structure. The conditions ensure that for any $\omega$ satisfying the quadratic equation $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, the polynomial $P(\omega)$ vanishes.

The symmetry suggests a systematic relationship between the coefficients $a_7, a_4, a_1$ and $a_8, a_5, a_2$, as well as between $a_6, a_3, a_0$ and $a_8, a_5, a_2$.

I'll explore the possible combinations of coefficients from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ that satisfy these constraints. By systematically counting the ways these three-term sums can be constructed, I can determine the potential values and their frequencies.

For $s = -3$, there's a single unique combination of $(-1, -1, -1)$.
For $s = -2$, three distinct arrangements exist, like $(-1, -1, 0)$ with its permutations.
For $s = -1$, six total ways emerge through combinations like $(-1, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, -1, 1)$.
For $s = 0$, seven methods appear, including $(0, 0, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 1)$ variations.
For $s = 1$, six approaches work, such as $(1, 0, 0)$ and $(1, 1, -1)$.
For $s = 2$, three permutations are possible with $(1, 1, 0)$.
For $s = 3$, only $(1, 1, 1)$ satisfies the condition.

Each value of $s$ represents a different constraint on the possible 9-tuple arrangements.

The total count calculates to $831$ by cubing and summing the ways for each $s$ value.
