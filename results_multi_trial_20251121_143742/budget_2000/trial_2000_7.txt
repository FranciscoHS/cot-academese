Let's call the polynomial $P(x) = a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

Note that $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Let's compute powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^3 = \omega \cdot \omega^2 = \omega(-\omega - 1) = -\omega^2 - \omega = -(-\omega - 1) - \omega = \omega + 1 - \omega = 1$

So $\omega^3 = 1$, which means the powers of $\omega$ repeat with period 3.

Similarly for $\omega^2$:
- $(\omega^2)^0 = 1$
- $(\omega^2)^1 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $(\omega^2)^2 = \omega^4 = \omega^{3+1} = \omega^3 \cdot \omega = 1 \cdot \omega = \omega$


- $(\omega^2)^3 = \omega^6 = (\omega^3)^2 = 1^2 = 1$

The powers of $\omega^2$ are also periodic with period 3.

When $P(\omega) = 0$, we get a constraint on the coefficients involving the periodic powers of $\omega$. This means the coefficients must satisfy specific relationships based on the cyclic nature of $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

Using the property $\omega^3 = 1$, I can simplify the higher powers of $\omega$ by reducing them to their equivalent lower-degree terms:
- $\omega^8$ reduces to $\omega^2$
- $\omega^7$ reduces to $\omega$
- $\omega^6$ reduces to 1
- $\omega^5$ reduces to $\omega^2$
- $\omega^4$ reduces to $\omega$
- $\omega^3$ reduces to 1

These simplifications will help me construct the polynomial equation more efficiently.

When I collect the terms from $P(\omega)$ and $P(\omega^2)$, I notice a pattern emerging. By grouping coefficients of $\omega^2$, $\omega$, and constant terms, I can create a system of equations that relates the original polynomial's coefficients.

I'll define summary variables $A$, $B$, and $C$ to represent grouped coefficient sums, which will help me analyze the relationships between the polynomial's coefficients at different roots of unity.

By manipulating these equations and using the fundamental property $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, I discover a critical constraint: the grouped coefficient sums must be equal. Specifically, $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = a_6 + a_3 + a_0$.

This reveals a symmetric condition that must hold true for the original polynomial's coefficients.

I recognize that each sum can take multiple integer values between -3 and 3, given the coefficient constraints of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. To determine the possible configurations, I'll systematically count the ways these three-term combinations can be constructed.

The key insight involves using polynomial expansion to enumerate these combinations, specifically by examining the coefficients of $(x^{-1} + 1 + x)^3$, which will reveal the distribution of possible sum configurations.

I'm now preparing to analyze the specific case of sum = -3, which will help me understand the broader pattern of coefficient arrangements.
