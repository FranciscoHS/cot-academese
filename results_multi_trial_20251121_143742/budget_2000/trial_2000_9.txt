Let $f(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

For $f(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $f(\omega) = 0$ and $f(\omega^2) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

The primitive cube roots of unity are the roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$, namely $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}$.

We have $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

So we need:
$f(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$f(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Now, since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
$\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
$\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
$\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
$\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$


$\omega^3 = \omega^{3 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
$\omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^0 = 1$

Substituting these values, $f(\omega)$ simplifies to a linear combination of $\omega^2$, $\omega$, and constant terms. This allows us to group coefficients and set up a system of equations to determine the conditions for divisibility.

The equation becomes:
$(a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0) = 0$

For $f(\omega^2)$, I'll compute the powers of $\omega^2$ systematically, noting how they reduce modulo 3. Each exponentiation reveals a pattern of cycling through $\omega$, $\omega^2$, and 1.

$(\omega^2)^1 = \omega^2$
$(\omega^2)^0 = 1$

The constraints require three linear combinations to equal zero:
$a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$
$a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$
$a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$

I'll need to count valid configurations of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ satisfying these conditions, which means systematically exploring combinations that make each sum zero.

For each constraint, I'm examining possible triples where the elements are from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ and total zero. The initial analysis reveals some key patterns: zero-sum triples include $(0, 0, 0)$ and permutations of $(-1, 0, 1)$, with careful attention to avoiding invalid combinations like $(1, 1, -2)$.

The valid triples will determine the total number of ways to construct solutions that meet these linear independence requirements.

By systematically counting unique zero-sum combinations, I find 7 distinct ways to select three values satisfying the constraint. This leads to a total of $7^3 = 343$ possible 9-tuples that can be constructed under these conditions.
