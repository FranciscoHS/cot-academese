We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity. Since $x^2 + x + 1$ has roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}$.

We have $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

Let me compute the powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So the powers of $\omega$ cycle with period 3.

We need:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$


$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$

I rearrange the terms to group coefficients by powers of $\omega$. The equation becomes a sum of three terms: constant, $\omega$, and $\omega^2$ coefficients. Each group must equal zero, creating constraints on the original polynomial coefficients.

Continuing the analysis, I define new sums $S_0$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ representing grouped coefficients. By manipulating these sums, I derive a relationship between them involving $\omega$. The key insight emerges when examining the condition $(S_1 - S_2)(\omega^2 - \omega) = 0$, which suggests a critical constraint on the polynomial's structure.

Exploring further, I find that $S_1$ must equal $S_2$. This leads to an additional constraint involving $\omega + \omega^2 = -1$, ultimately revealing that $S_0$, $S_1$, and $S_2$ must be equal. 

The profound result is a symmetric condition on the coefficients: the sum of every third coefficient must be identical across different groups. This symmetry implies a precise arrangement of the original $a_i$ values, suggesting a highly structured underlying pattern.

I'll systematically count the possible ways to achieve each sum value from $-3$ to $3$ using triples of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. The initial counts reveal interesting distributions:
- $S = -3$ has a single configuration
- $S = -2$ allows three distinct arrangements
- $S = -1$ presents more complex possibilities involving zero and negative values

I'll carefully track each sum's unique combinations, noting the permutations that generate equivalent sums. The goal is precise enumeration of these triples.

For $S = 0$, I notice multiple interesting pathways emerging, with combinations like $(0,0,0)$ and $(-1,0,1)$ creating distinct ways to achieve zero.

The systematic approach ensures I capture every possible configuration without overlooking subtle variations in the triple arrangements.

By cubing each count and summing, I arrive at 831 total 9-tuples, representing the comprehensive set of three-variable combinations across the $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ domain.

The progression from $S = -3$ to $S = 3$ reveals a symmetric pattern of combinatorial possibilities, with the middle sum $(S = 0)$ representing the most diverse set of arrangements.
