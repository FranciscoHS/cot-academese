Let $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, which means that $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

We know that $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$ and $\omega^3 = 1$.

Let me compute the powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$

So we have:
$P(\omega) = a_8(-\omega - 1) + a_7\omega + a_6 \cdot 1 + a_5(-\omega - 1) + a_4\omega + a_3 \cdot 1 + a_2(-\omega - 1) + a_1\omega + a_0 \cdot 1$
$= -a_8\omega - a_8 + a_7\omega + a_6 - a_5\omega - a_5 + a_4\omega + a_3 - a_2\omega - a_2 + a_1\omega + a_0$


$= \omega(-a_8 + a_7 - a_5 + a_4 - a_2 + a_1) + (-a_8 + a_6 - a_5 + a_3 - a_2 + a_0)$

To satisfy $P(\omega) = 0$, two conditions must hold:
$-a_8 + a_7 - a_5 + a_4 - a_2 + a_1 = 0$
$-a_8 + a_6 - a_5 + a_3 - a_2 + a_0 = 0$

I'll explore $P(\omega^2)$ by substituting $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$. This transformation allows me to manipulate the polynomial expression, revealing key relationships between the coefficients. By replacing $-\omega^2 - 1$ with $\omega$, I can simplify the complex polynomial into a more manageable form, setting the stage for further algebraic analysis.

The resulting expression involves strategic coefficient rearrangements, creating a pattern that connects different terms through the unique property of $\omega$.

I'll focus on the constraints emerging from setting $P(\omega^2) = 0$, which generate a system of linear equations linking the coefficients $a_0$ through $a_8. These constraints reveal intricate interdependencies that must be satisfied for the polynomial to have specific roots.

The key observation is how these constraints create symmetrical relationships between the coefficients, suggesting a structured approach to solving the underlying algebraic problem.

By manipulating the equations, I can see that some constraints appear to be linearly dependent, which means the system might have fewer truly independent conditions than initially apparent.

The critical equation $a_8 - a_7 + a_5 - a_4 + a_2 - a_1 = 0$ seems particularly significant, as it encapsulates a pattern of alternating signs and specific coefficient interactions.

With two independent linear constraints on nine variables, I calculate 7 degrees of freedom. Since each variable can take three possible values (-1, 0, 1), the potential solution space would initially suggest $3^7 = 2187$ possible configurations.

However, I'm skeptical of this initial calculation and recognize the need for more rigorous verification to ensure the mathematical integrity of the solution set.

The key constraint involves divisibility by $x^2 + x + 1$, which means the polynomial must vanish when evaluated at the primitive cube roots of unity. These roots, $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, create specific conditions that
