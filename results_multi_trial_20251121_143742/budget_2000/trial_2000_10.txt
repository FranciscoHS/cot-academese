We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $p(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

Since $p(x)$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $p(\omega) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive third roots of unity. We have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$.

Also, $\omega^3 = 1$ (since $\omega$ is a primitive third root of unity).

So we need:
$p(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$


- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

Substituting these relations, we can simplify $p(\omega)$ to a compact form. By grouping terms with $\omega^2$ and $\omega$, we get a linear combination that must equal zero. This means the coefficients of $\omega^2$ and $\omega$ must sum to specific values determined by the original polynomial coefficients.

The key insight is that the coefficients at positions equivalent modulo 3 must collectively sum to zero. This creates three distinct constraints on the coefficient selection, requiring careful combinatorial analysis of possible value combinations.

By systematically exploring ways to choose three values from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ that sum to zero, we find 7 distinct arrangements per constraint. Since these constraints operate independently, the total number of valid coefficient configurations becomes $7^3 = 343$ unique 9-tuples.
