Let me work through this step by step.

If the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, then any root of $x^2 + x + 1$ must also be a root of our polynomial.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the complex cube roots of unity other than 1. Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity. Then $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$.

The roots are $\omega$ and $\omega^2 = \overline{\omega}$.

If our polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, then:
- $P(\omega) = 0$
- $P(\omega^2) = 0$

Now, let's compute the powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So we have the pattern: the powers of $\omega$ cycle with period 3.
- $\omega^{3k} = 1$
- $\omega^{3k+1} = \omega$
- $\omega^{3k+2} = \omega^2$

Therefore:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$


$= a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 \cdot 1 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 \cdot 1 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

I rearrange the terms to group coefficients of $\omega^2$, $\omega$, and constant terms. This reveals a compact representation of the polynomial's evaluation at $\omega$.

The grouped terms show a systematic pattern where coefficients of the same power are collected together, which will be crucial for determining the conditions for divisibility.

For $P(\omega) = 0$:
$(a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0) = 0$

I define simplified coefficients $A$, $B$, and $C$ to represent these grouped terms, which transforms the complex polynomial into a more manageable form. By setting up these equations, I'm preparing to explore the relationships between the coefficients and potential roots.

Substituting the first equation's rearrangement into the second creates an opportunity to derive constraints on the polynomial's structure.

The key insight emerges when manipulating the equations: $A$ must equal $B$, which implies the grouped coefficients are equivalent. This means $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = a_6 + a_3 + a_0$.

Since each $a_i$ can only be $-1$, $0$, or $1$, these grouped sums can range from $-3$ to $3$, providing a bounded constraint on the possible coefficient configurations.

I'll systematically count the possible arrangements for each potential sum $k$. For $k = -3$, there's only one configuration: $(-1, -1, -1)$. At $k = -2$, three distinct arrangements emerge through permutations of $(-1, -1, 0)$. For $k = -1$, complexity increases with six total
