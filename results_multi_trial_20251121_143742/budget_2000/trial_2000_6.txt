Let $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the complex cube roots of unity other than 1. These are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.

So we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

Let's compute $P(\omega)$:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$


- $\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$

Substituting these values, we get a simplified expression for $P(\omega)$ involving grouped coefficients. The key observation is how the powers of $\omega$ reduce to a cyclic pattern due to $\omega^3 = 1$.

For $P(\omega^2)$, we apply similar modular reduction. The exponents of $\omega$ get transformed through $\bmod 3$, causing each term to simplify to a reduced power. This creates a systematic way of condensing the polynomial's representation using the fundamental property $\omega^3 = 1$.

The resulting polynomial gets grouped by powers of $\omega$, collecting coefficients from the original terms. We end up with a compact representation that allows us to set up conditions for $P(\omega)$ and $P(\omega^2)$ to simultaneously equal zero.

By collecting like terms, we create an equation where the constant, $\omega$, and $\omega^2$ coefficients can be systematically analyzed. This sets the stage for solving the constraint that both polynomial evaluations must vanish.

The key insight emerges from the linear independence of $\{1, \omega, \omega^2\}$ over $\mathbb{R}$, which means each coefficient group must independently sum to zero. This transforms our complex polynomial problem into a counting challenge involving triples of values from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$.

We're now focused on enumerating the ways three values from this set can be chosen to sum precisely to zero, which becomes a combinatorial problem of finding valid coefficient arrangements.

By systematically examining possible triples, we discover 7 unique configurations that satisfy the zero-sum constraint: the trivial $(0, 0, 0)$ and 6 permutations involving $1, -1, 0$. This leads to a straightforward calculation of total arrangements: $7^3 = 343$ distinct 9-tuples meeting our mathematical conditions.
