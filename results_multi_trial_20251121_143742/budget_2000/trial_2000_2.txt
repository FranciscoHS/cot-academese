[Thinking block 1]
We have a polynomial $p(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ for $i = 0, 1, \dots, 8$.

We need $p(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let's think about $x^2 + x + 1$. The roots of this polynomial are the primitive cube roots of unity. Specifically, if we let $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$, then $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

So for $p(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $p(\omega) = 0$ and $p(\omega^2) = 0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we can simplify powers of $\omega$:
$\omega^0 = 1$
$\omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^3 = 1$
$\omega^4 = \omega$
$\omega^5 = \omega^2$
$\omega^6 = 1$
$\omega^7 = \omega$
$\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So:
$p(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Grouping by powers of $\omega$:
$p(\omega) = (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2$


$p(\omega)$ must equal zero, which means three conditions must hold: the constant term, $\omega$ term, and $\omega^2$ term must all sum to zero.

This requires three specific constraints on the coefficients: each group of three coefficients (shifted by 3 indices) must sum to zero. These constraints will significantly limit the possible polynomials that satisfy the divisibility condition.

When we examine $p(\omega^2)$, we discover these same constraints emerge naturally. By systematically tracking the powers of $\omega^2$, we find the coefficient groupings produce identical zero-sum requirements.

This symmetry suggests a deep structural property of the polynomial, where the divisibility conditions create a precise, repeating pattern across different roots of unity.

The constraint equations demand each triad of coefficients - $a_0, a_3, a_6$ and so on - must balance to zero, using only values from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. I'll explore the possible arrangements that satisfy these conditions.

For the equation $x + y + z = 0$ with values restricted to $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, I'm investigating the solution set. So far, I've identified the $(0, 0, 0)$ trivial solution and the six permutations of $(1, -1, 0)$. The pattern suggests a systematic way to count valid coefficient combinations.

By multiplying these 7 unique solutions across three independent equations, I calculate the total possible 9-tuple arrangements as $7^3 = 343$ distinct configurations that meet the original constraints.
