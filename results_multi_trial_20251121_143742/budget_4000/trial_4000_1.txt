Let me work through this step by step.

First, let's understand what it means for a polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The polynomial $x^2 + x + 1$ has roots that are the primitive cube roots of unity. Let $\omega$ be a root of $x^2 + x + 1$, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

Since $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, we have $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$. Also, note that $\omega^3 = 1$ since the roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ are the primitive third roots of unity.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$.

So we need $a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we can reduce the powers of $\omega$ modulo 3:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$ 
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 \cdot 1 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 \cdot 1 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 \cdot 1$.
 
I'll rearrange the terms to show how the coefficients group together when evaluated at $\omega$. By collecting like powers of $\omega$, we get a compact representation of the divisibility condition. The key insight is that the coefficients must satisfy specific relationships to ensure the polynomial vanishes at $\omega$.

The grouped terms reveal three critical conditions that must be met simultaneously. These conditions create a system of linear constraints on the polynomial's coefficients, which determine whether the entire polynomial is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Examining the possible combinations reveals a limited set of valid arrangements. We can construct zero-sum triples using the values $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ through two primary methods:
- A single instance of each value: 6 permutations
- A uniform zero configuration: 1 unique way

This means we have 7 total valid configurations for each of the three grouped coefficient sums.

Since these three equations operate independently, we multiply the possibilities: $7^3 = 343$ total unique 9-tuple arrangements satisfy the constraints.

The key insight is the independence of each three-term grouping, allowing us to systematically count potential solutions by combining the distinct zero-sum combinations.
