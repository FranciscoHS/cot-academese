I need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

If $P(x)$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, then the roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ must also be roots of $P(x)$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity. Let me call them $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}$.

We have:
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$
- $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$

So we need:
- $P(\omega) = 0$
- $P(\omega^2) = 0$

Let me compute powers of $\omega$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

Similarly for $\omega^2$:


- $1$
- $\omega^2$
- $\omega$
- $1$
- $\omega^2$
- $\omega$
- $1$
- $\omega^2$
- $\omega$

These power patterns will help me determine the conditions for divisibility by $x^2 + x + 1$.

I notice the polynomial $P(\omega)$ can be restructured by grouping coefficients. The equation involves terms with $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, suggesting a systematic approach to analyzing the coefficients. By collecting like terms, we can simplify the complex polynomial representation and potentially reveal underlying patterns in its structure.

The grouping reveals a potential method to understand how the coefficients interact across different powers of $\omega$, which could provide insights into the polynomial's behavior and roots.

I'll need to count the possible combinations of coefficients that satisfy the linear independence constraint, focusing on the sets $\{a_0, a_3, a_6\}$, $\{a_1, a_4, a_7\}$, and $\{a_2, a_5, a_8\}$. Each set must sum to zero, with coefficients restricted to $\{-1, 0, 1\}$.

The goal is to systematically determine the number of unique ways these coefficient sets can be arranged while maintaining the specified condition.

For each set, I find there are 7 distinct ways to choose three values that sum to zero: one combination of all zeros, and six permutations involving one positive, one negative, and one zero value.

By applying these independent constraints across the three coefficient sets, I calculate the total number of possible 9-tuples as $7^3 = 343$ unique configurations.
