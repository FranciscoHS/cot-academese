[Thinking block 1]
Let's think about this step by step. We need to find 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity. We have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$. Also, $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$.

Let me compute $\omega^k$ for various $k$:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$  
- $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2 = -\omega - 1$

So we have:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$


$= a_8(-\omega - 1) + a_7\omega + a_6(1) + a_5(-\omega - 1) + a_4\omega + a_3(1) + a_2(-\omega - 1) + a_1\omega + a_0$

I'll rearrange the terms, grouping coefficients of $\omega$ and constant terms. The goal is to set this entire expression to zero, which means carefully manipulating the coefficients.

$= \omega(-a_8 + a_7 - a_5 + a_4 - a_2 + a_1) + (-a_8 + a_6 - a_5 + a_3 - a_2 + a_0)$

To make $P(\omega) = 0$, I need two specific conditions to hold simultaneously. These conditions involve precise relationships between the polynomial's coefficients, ensuring the entire expression vanishes when $\omega$ is substituted.

The first condition requires $-a_8 + a_7 - a_5 + a_4 - a_2 + a_1 = 0$, while the second demands $-a_8 + a_6 - a_5 + a_3 - a_2 + a_0 = 0$. These equations represent critical constraints on the polynomial's structure.

When examining $P(\omega^2)$, I systematically substitute $\omega^2$ and leverage the cyclical properties of $\omega^3 = 1$, which generates predictable transformations of the coefficients.

By setting $P(\omega^2) = 0$, I derive two critical constraint equations. These equations establish relationships between the coefficients that must hold true for the polynomial to vanish when evaluated at $\omega^2$.

The first equation reveals a balanced interaction between $a_8, a_7, a_5, a_4, a_2,$ and $a_1$, where their weighted contributions must precisely cancel out. The second equation similarly constrains $a_7, a_6, a_4, a_3, a_1,$ and $a_0$ to maintain equilibrium.

By manipulating these equations, I can systematically explore potential coefficient configurations that satisfy the polynomial's fundamental constraints. I have 9 variables with 3 choices each, constrained by 2 linear equations. Initially, I calculated $3^7 = 2187$ possible solutions. However, this number exceeds 999, which seems unlikely for an AIME problem.

I'm skeptical about my initial calculation. The constraints might not be truly independent when considered in $\mathbb{Z}/3\mathbb{Z}$, or I might be overlooking a critical detail. I need to carefully verify the system's constraints, potentially checking their behavior in different mathematical fields.

My next step is to rigorously examine the constraints' properties, ensuring they hold not just in $\mathbb{Z}$, but potentially in other modular arithmetic contexts that might limit the solution space. I realize $3^7 = 2187$ exceeds the 999 limit for AIME answers. The constraints allow 7 free variables with 3 possible values each, but this generates too many solutions. I need to carefully reconsider the constraint equations and the requirement that each $a_i$ is restricted to $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. The current approach of freely selecting 7 variables won't work for finding a solution within the specified range.
