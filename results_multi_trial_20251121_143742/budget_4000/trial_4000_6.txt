Let's denote the polynomial as $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The polynomial $x^2 + x + 1$ has roots that are the complex cube roots of unity other than 1. Let me call these roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i$.

We have $\omega^3 = 1$, $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Let's compute $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So $P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$.


Rearranging the terms reveals a pattern of coefficients grouped by powers of $\omega$. The condition for $P(\omega)$ to equal zero requires specific relationships between the coefficients, creating a system of linear constraints that must be satisfied.

When examining $P(\omega^2)$, the powers of $\omega^2$ cycle through a predictable sequence due to the cubic root of unity property. This cyclic behavior transforms the original polynomial, compressing the exponents and redistributing the coefficients in a systematic way.

The transformed polynomial shows how the original coefficients map onto a reduced set of terms, reflecting the underlying symmetry of the cubic roots of unity.

By grouping the coefficients based on their cyclic pattern, we derive three key constraint equations that must be satisfied simultaneously. These constraints require specific relationships between the coefficients $a_0$ through $a_8$, each of which can only take values from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$.

The emerging pattern suggests a structured approach to constructing polynomials that vanish when evaluated at $\omega^2$, with precise conditions governing the coefficient selection.

I'll systematically explore the possible combinations where $a + b + c = 0$, considering the restricted value set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. The goal is to determine the total number of unique solutions that satisfy these stringent constraints.

Counting reveals multiple solution configurations: a single trivial case where all values are zero, and several permutations involving one positive, one negative, and one neutral value. The complexity emerges from the combinatorial possibilities of arranging these values across different variables.

By extending this local pattern to a 9-tuple grid, where each 3x3 section must independently satisfy the zero-sum condition, we generate a multiplicative effect. Specifically, each independent section contributes 7 possible arrangements, leading to a total of $7^3 = 343$ unique 9-tuples meeting the specified requirements.
