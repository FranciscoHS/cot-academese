Let $f(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$. We need $f(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $\omega$ be a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$. Then $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, which means $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$. Also, $\omega^3 = \omega \cdot \omega^2 = \omega(-\omega - 1) = -\omega^2 - \omega = -(-\omega - 1) - \omega = \omega + 1 - \omega = 1$.

So $\omega$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity, and $\omega^3 = 1$.

Since $x^2 + x + 1$ divides $f(x)$, we need $f(\omega) = 0$.

Now, let's compute $f(\omega)$:
$f(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2 + 2} = (\omega^3)^2 \cdot \omega^2 = 1^2 \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2 + 1} = (\omega^3)^2 \cdot \omega = \omega$


- $\omega^6 = (\omega^3)^2 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^{3 + 2} = \omega^3 \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^{3 + 1} = \omega^3 \cdot \omega = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$

Substituting these values, $f(\omega)$ simplifies to a linear combination of $\omega^2$ and $\omega$ terms, along with constant terms.

To make $f(\omega)$ equal zero, the coefficients of $\omega^2$, $\omega$, and the constant term must each sum to zero. This requires specific relationships between the original coefficients $a_8$ through $a_0$.

The key constraint is that the sums of coefficients in each power of $\omega$ must vanish, creating a system of linear equations that the original coefficients must satisfy.

Since $x^2 + x + 1$ is irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$, if $\omega$ is a root of $f(x)$, then $\omega^2$ is automatically also a root. This means we only need to verify two specific coefficient sum conditions to ensure $f(\omega) = 0$.

For each equation requiring $a + b + c = 0$ with $a, b, c \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, I'll systematically count possible solutions. When all three values are zero, we have one solution. When one value is 1, another is -1, and the third is 0, we have three distinct arrangements, totaling four possible solutions per equation.

I'll carefully verify each combination that satisfies the zero-sum constraint. The solutions include $(0, 0, 0)$ and six unique permutations like $(1, -1, 0)$ and $(-1, 0, 1)$, ensuring no repeated configurations.

The key insight is systematically exploring how to distribute $-1$, $0$, and $1$ across three positions to achieve a sum of zero. This requires strategic placement of positive and negative values to balance the total.

I'll need to count the distinct arrangements carefully, considering the unique ways these three values can be positioned to maintain the zero-sum requirement.

For the first constraint, I've identified 7 possible solutions: one all-zero configuration and six mixed configurations involving $-1$, $0$, and $1$. This emerges from methodically selecting positions for each value while ensuring the total remains zero.

With multiple independent constraints and 9 total coefficients, the problem demands precise tracking of placement rules and combinatorial possibilities.

The key insight is that 6 variables can be freely chosen, while 3 are determined by the specific zero-sum constraints across different coefficient indices. Each constraint follows a similar pattern: selecting two variables allows the third to be mathematically derived, provided it meets the $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ condition.

For the specific constraint $a + b + c = 0$, the challenge lies in ensuring the third variable's value remains within the allowed set through strategic selection of the first two variables.

By examining possible combinations, we find valid $(a,b)$ pairs that restrict the third variable:
- When $a + b = -1$, two valid pairs emerge: $(-1, 0)$ and $(0, -1)$
- When $a + b = 0$, three valid pairs exist: $(-1, 1), (0, 0), (1, -1)$
- When $a + b = 1$, two valid pairs appear: $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$

This yields 7 total valid pairs, allowing 7 ways to select values for each constraint.

I can strategically choose values for specific variable pairs, recognizing each selection determines subsequent variables. However, I need to carefully consider which variables remain flexible in my selection process.

My approach involves systematically choosing values for consecutive variable pairs, understanding how each choice impacts the remaining unassigned variables.

By selecting 6 variables freely from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, I generate $3^6$ potential configurations. These selections will then determine the remaining variables through specific constraint relationships.

The key constraints require ensuring that the sum of paired variables falls within the acceptable range of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, which will validate the overall variable assignment strategy.

For each pair of variables, 7 distinct combinations satisfy the sum constraint. Multiplying these possibilities across three independent pairs yields $7^3 = 343$ total valid 9-variable configurations.
