Let $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$. Let's denote the roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ by $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

We have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^3 = 1$, $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$. Also, $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ are the two complex cube roots of unity other than 1.

If $P(x)$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, then $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So we need:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$P(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
$\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \mod 3} = \omega^2$
$\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \mod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \mod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
$\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \mod 3} = \omega^2$


$\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \mod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^3 = 1$
$\omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^1 = \omega$

The condition $P(\omega) = 0$ simplifies to a sum involving $\omega^2$ and $\omega$ terms, reflecting the periodic nature of the cube roots of unity.

Grouping the coefficients reveals three key equations:
$a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$
$a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$
$a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$

These conditions emerge from the cyclic properties of $\omega$, where each coefficient group must sum to zero.

Examining $\omega^2$ powers shows a repeating pattern of $\omega$, $1$, and $\omega^2$. This cyclic behavior generates additional constraints on the coefficients, creating a systematic relationship between the polynomial's terms.

By grouping coefficients, we derive three key conditions linking specific indices. These conditions enforce a precise balance across the polynomial's structure, requiring certain coefficient combinations to sum to zero.

The conditions demand that $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, $a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$, and the final condition remains truncated, suggesting a consistent pattern of coefficient interactions.

For the first equation $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, we explore possible combinations within the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. The goal is finding arrangements that precisely balance to zero, with permutations revealing multiple solution pathways.

Specifically, the $(-1, 0, 1)$ combination offers six distinct permutations, representing the primary mechanism for satisfying this constraint.

Additional valid configurations include $(1, 0, -1)$ and $(0, 0, 0)$, with the latter representing a unique single arrangement where all values are zero.

We systematically eliminate impossible scenarios like $(1, 1, -2)$, which falls outside the permitted value range, ensuring strict adherence to the problem's defined set of allowable values.

By calculating permutations of $(1, 0, -1)$ and accounting for the zero configuration, we derive $6 + 1 = 7$ distinct ways for each constraint.

Multiplying these possibilities across the 9-tuple yields a total of $7^3 = 343$ valid arrangements.
