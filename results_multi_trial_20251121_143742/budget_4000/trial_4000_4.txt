Let $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We want $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ are the primitive third roots of unity. Let's call them $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$. We have $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Let's compute $P(\omega)$:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we can reduce all powers modulo 3:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = \omega^{3 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$


$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 \cdot 1 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 \cdot 1 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$
$= (a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0)$

I'll rearrange the terms to group coefficients with the same power of $\omega$. This simplifies the expression and helps us see the conditions for $P(\omega)$ to equal zero.

When setting $P(\omega) = 0$, the coefficients of each $\omega$ term must independently sum to zero. This means three separate equations emerge, each constraining different coefficients of the original polynomial.

The key conditions require:
- Quadratic coefficient sum is zero
- Linear coefficient sum is zero
- Constant term sum is zero

I'll now examine how $P(\omega^2)$ behaves, noting the cyclic properties of $\omega$ when raised to various powers. The cubic root of unity introduces interesting transformations when computing higher power terms.

By systematically reducing each power of $\omega^2$ modulo 3, I discover consistent patterns: some terms reduce to $\omega$, some to $\omega^2$, and some to 1.

When substituting these reduced powers back into the polynomial, I find the same three coefficient constraints emerge: each group of three coefficients (shifted by different indices) must sum to zero.

This symmetry suggests a deeper structural relationship within the polynomial's coefficients, implying significant constraints on the original polynomial's construction.

I'll now methodically explore the possible combinations for these coefficient constraints, focusing on the first equation $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$. By carefully examining the allowed values $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, I can systematically count valid configurations that satisfy these conditions.

The initial analysis reveals multiple ways these coefficients can balance, with some combinations generating multiple permutations while maintaining the zero-sum requirement.

For the first equation, I find 7 distinct ways to select coefficients: one all-zero configuration and six unique permutations of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ that sum to zero. Since the equations are independent, I can apply this same 7-configuration principle to the other two equations.

By multiplying these independent possibilities - $7 \times 7 \times 7$ - I calculate a total of 343 unique 9-tuple configurations that satisfy all three constraint equations.
