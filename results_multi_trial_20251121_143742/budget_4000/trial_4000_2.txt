Let me denote the polynomial as $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

We need $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive third root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$. The roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So we have:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$P(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1(\omega^2) + a_0 = 0$

Now, since $\omega^3 = 1$, we can reduce the powers of $\omega$ modulo 3:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$


$= (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$

This means the coefficients of $P(x)$ must satisfy specific conditions. The equation implies that the sum of coefficients in each group must equal zero when evaluated at the roots of $x^2 + x + 1$.

I observe that the two equations are symmetric, with the terms rearranged differently. This suggests a structured relationship between the coefficients $a_0$ through $a_8$. The pattern indicates a systematic way of grouping and summing these coefficients to create a zero polynomial.

The key constraints require each group of three coefficients to sum to zero, with the coefficients restricted to the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. I'll need to systematically count the number of solutions where $x + y + z = 0$ for each group, considering the possible combinations of $-1, 0, 1$.

For the first constraint involving $x + y + z = 0$, I'm starting to count the possible arrangements where $x = -1$, which means $y + z$ must equal 1 to maintain the zero sum condition.

When $x = -1$, the valid solutions are $(0, 1)$ and $(1, 0)$ pairs. Similarly, for $x = 0$ and $x = 1$, I'll find the corresponding valid combinations that satisfy the zero sum constraint.

By carefully enumerating these combinations, I determine there are 7 unique solutions for each independent constraint. Multiplying these independent solutions yields a total of $7^3 = 343$ possible valid 9-tuples that meet the original conditions.

The systematic approach of checking each possible $x$ value and its corresponding $y + z$ constraints allows me to comprehensively identify all valid solution sets.
