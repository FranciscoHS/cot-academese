We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

To do this, I need to find a substitution $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is some scaling factor, such that when I substitute this into the original polynomial, I get the desired form.

Let me substitute $x = \alpha y$:
$a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3$
$= a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$

I want this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So I need:
- Coefficient of $y^7$: $a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$
- Coefficient of $y^2$: $a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$
- Constant term: $a_3 = 1$

Wait, that last condition $a_3 = 1$ seems too restrictive. Let me think about this differently.

Actually, I think I need to scale the entire polynomial by some factor. Let me try:

$\frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3)$ and substitute $x = \alpha y$

$= \frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3)$
$= \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} y^7 + \frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{\beta} y^2 + \frac{a_3}{\beta}$


$= \epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$

I determine $\beta$ is equal to $a_3$, which allows me to relate $\alpha$ to the coefficients. By setting $\frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{a_3} = 1$, I can derive that $\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$, which provides a clear relationship between the scaling parameters.

Substituting this into the first equation, I manipulate the terms to express $\epsilon$ as a function of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$. By carefully rearranging the algebraic expressions, I transform the equation to $\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$, revealing the intricate connections between these coefficients.

Looking at this nondimensionalization problem, I need to find a transformation that converts the given polynomial into the target form.

Let me use a combined scaling approach: I'll scale both the variable and the entire polynomial.

Let $x = \alpha y$ and multiply the polynomial by a factor $\frac{1}{\beta}$:

$$\frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3) = \frac{1}{\beta}(a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3)$$

This gives:
$$\frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} y^7 + \frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{\beta} y^2 + \frac{a_3}{\beta}$$

For this to match $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, I need:

1) Constant term: $\frac{a_3}{\beta} = 1 \Rightarrow \beta = a_3$

2) Coefficient of $y^2$: $\frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{\beta} = 1 \Rightarrow \frac{a_2 \alpha^2}{a_3} = 1 \Rightarrow \alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$

3) Coefficient of $y^7$: $\epsilon = \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{\beta} = \frac{a_1 \alpha^7}{a_3}$

Substituting the expression for $\alpha^2$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \alpha^7 = \frac{a_1}{a_3} (\alpha^2)^{7/2} = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

Simplifying:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{a_3^{7/2}}{a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}}$$

We want to nondimensionalize the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

Let's make a substitution $x = \alpha y$, where $\alpha$ is some scaling factor to be determined.

Then the polynomial becomes:
$a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3$
$= a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$

We want this to be in the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

So we need:
- The constant term: $a_3 = 1$
- The $y^2$ coefficient: $a_2 \alpha^2 = 1$
- The $y^7$ coefficient: $a_1 \alpha^7 = \epsilon$

From the constant term condition: This means we need to first divide the entire polynomial by $a_3$ to get the constant term to be 1.

Actually, let me be more careful. We want to transform $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

Let me make the substitution $x = \alpha y$ and also scale the entire polynomial by some factor $\beta$.

So we have:
$\beta (a_1 (\alpha y)^7 + a_2 (\alpha y)^2 + a_3)$
$= \beta a_1 \alpha^7 y^7 + \beta a_2 \alpha^2 y^2 + \beta a_3$

We want this to equal $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.


I can determine the scaling factors by solving these conditions. The scaling factor $\beta$ is simply the reciprocal of $a_3$, which ensures the constant term becomes 1. For $\alpha$, I'll solve for its value by relating it to the coefficients, ensuring the $y^2$ term has a coefficient of 1. This approach allows me to systematically transform the original polynomial into the desired nondimensional form.

By taking the square root of $\frac{a_3}{a_2}$ and carefully tracking the exponents, I derive $\alpha = \sqrt{\frac{a_3}{a_2}}$. This choice ensures the quadratic term becomes standardized. 

When I substitute this value and manipulate the coefficients, I find $\epsilon$ can be expressed as $\frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$, which provides a precise relationship between the original polynomial's coefficients.

Continuing the transformation, I systematically substitute the defined $\alpha$ and simplify the resulting expression, revealing a normalized polynomial form with interesting coefficient interactions.

The key observation involves carefully manipulating fractional exponents, specifically reducing $a_3^{7/2}/a_3$ to $a_3^{5/2}$ through precise exponent arithmetic. This allows me to express $\epsilon$ as a ratio of scaled parameters.

I'm now exploring an alternative representation that might provide more standard mathematical notation, focusing on the relationship between $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$ through their fractional power interactions.

The calculation involves complex exponent manipulations, revealing intricate relationships between the parameters that require careful algebraic reduction and simplification.

I'm transforming a polynomial by introducing a scaling parameter $y$ related to the original variable $x$ through $x = \alpha y$. The goal is to systematically adjust coefficients to achieve a standardized polynomial form with specific constraints.

By substituting $x$ with $\alpha y$, I'm setting up a systematic transformation that will allow precise control over the polynomial's structural elements, focusing on normalizing its coefficients and constant term.

The key steps involve dividing by the constant term $a_3$, then establishing relationships between $\alpha$ and the original coefficients to ensure the transformed polynomial meets specific requirements for its $y^2$ and $y^7$ terms.

I'll determine $\alpha$ by establishing conditions that make the coefficient of $y^2$ exactly 1 and the coefficient of $y^7$ equal to $\epsilon$, creating a precise mapping between the original and transformed polynomials.

By manipulating the exponents and coefficients, I derive an expression for $\epsilon$ that depends on the ratios between $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$, specifically $\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$.

The final form reveals a structured relationship where $\epsilon$ emerges from carefully balanced coefficient transformations across different polynomial terms.

Looking at this problem, I need to find a change of variables that transforms the polynomial $a_1 x^7 + a_2 x^2 + a_3$ into the standard form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$.

Let me use the substitution $x = \alpha y$, where $\alpha$ is a scaling parameter to be determined.

Substituting into the original polynomial:
$$a_1(\alpha y)^7 + a_2(\alpha y)^2 + a_3 = a_1\alpha^7 y^7 + a_2\alpha^2 y^2 + a_3$$

To get the desired form, I need to scale this entire expression by an appropriate factor. To make the constant term equal to 1, I'll divide by $a_3$:

$$\frac{a_1\alpha^7 y^7 + a_2\alpha^2 y^2 + a_3}{a_3} = \frac{a_1\alpha^7}{a_3}y^7 + \frac{a_2\alpha^2}{a_3}y^2 + 1$$

Now I need this to match the form $\epsilon y^7 + y^2 + 1$, which means:

1) The coefficient of $y^2$ must equal 1:
$$\frac{a_2\alpha^2}{a_3} = 1$$
$$\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$$

2) The coefficient of $y^7$ equals $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1\alpha^7}{a_3}$$

From condition 1, I have $\alpha^2 = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$, so:
$$\alpha^7 = (\alpha^2)^{7/2} = \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

Substituting this into the expression for $\epsilon$:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^{7/2}$$

Simplifying:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \cdot \frac{a_3^{7/2}}{a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1 a_3^{7/2}}{a_3 a_2^{7/2}} = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^{5/2}}{a_2^{7/2}}}$$
