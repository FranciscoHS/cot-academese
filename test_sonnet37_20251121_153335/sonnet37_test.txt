CHAIN OF THOUGHT (FULL)
======================================================================

[Thinking block 1]
Let's try to solve this step by step.

We're looking for tuples $(a_0, a_1, ..., a_8)$ such that each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, and the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + ... + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + ... + a_1x + a_0$ be the polynomial. For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(x) = (x^2 + x + 1) \cdot Q(x)$ for some polynomial $Q(x)$.

Now, let's think about what it means for $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

One approach is to use the fact that if $x^2 + x + 1$ divides $P(x)$, then $P(\omega) = 0$ for any root $\omega$ of $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity, namely, $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}$. 

So, $P(x)$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$ if and only if $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

But actually, since $\omega^2$ is the complex conjugate of $\omega$, and since $P(x)$ has real coefficients, we know that $P(\omega^2) = 0$ is equivalent to $P(\omega) = 0$. So, we only need to check that $P(\omega) = 0$.

Let's compute what $P(\omega) = 0$ gives us:

$a_8 \omega^8 + a_7 \omega^7 + ... + a_1 \omega + a_0 = 0$.

We know that $\omega^3 = 1$ (since $\omega$ is a cube root of unity), so $\omega^{k+3} = \omega^k$ for any $k$. This means:
$\omega^0 = 1$
$\omega^1 = \omega$
$\omega^2 = \omega^2$
$\omega^3 = 1$
$\omega^4 = \omega$
$\omega^5 = \omega^2$
$\omega^6 = 1$
$\omega^7 = \omega$
$\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So, $P(\omega)$ becomes:
$a_8 \omega^2 + a_7 \omega + a_6 \cdot 1 + a_5 \omega^2 + a_4 \omega + a_3 \cdot 1 + a_2 \omega^2 + a_1 \omega + a_0 \cdot 1 = 0$

Collecting terms:
$(a_8 + a_5 + a_2) \omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1) \omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0) = 0$

Now, for this equation to be true, each coefficient of $\omega^k$ must be zero, since the powers of $\omega$ are linearly independent over the reals. So, we get:

$a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$
$a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$
$a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$

So, we need to count the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, ..., a_8)$ such that each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the above three constraints are satisfied.

For each constraint, we need to determine how many ways we can choose three numbers from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that their sum is 0.

The possible combinations for three numbers from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ to sum to 0 are:
(0, 0, 0) - Sum: 0
(1, 0, -1) and permutations (6 ways) - Sum: 0
(-1, 0, 1) and permutations (6 ways) - Sum: 0
(1, -1, 0) and permutations (6 ways) - Sum: 0
(-1, 1, 0) and permutations (6 ways) - Sum: 0
(1, 1, -1-1) - Sum: 0
(-1, -1, 1+1) - Sum: 0

But wait, the last two combinations aren't valid because we're restricted to numbers from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. So, there are 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 25 ways for a triple $(a_i, a_j, a_k)$ to sum to 0.

However, I made a mistake above. I need to be more careful about the permutations.

Let's list all possible combinations of three numbers from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that their sum is 0:
1. (0, 0, 0) - Sum: 0
2. (1, -1, 0) - Sum: 0
3. (-1, 1, 0) - Sum: 0
4. (1, 0, -1) - Sum: 0
5. (-1, 0, 1) - Sum: 0
6. (0, 1, -1) - Sum: 0
7. (0, -1, 1) - Sum: 0

But wait, I'm overcounting. (2) and (3) are essentially the same, just the order of the numbers changed. Similarly for (4) and (5) as well as (6) and (7).

Let me recalculate. The possible distinct combinations are:
1. (0, 0, 0) - Sum: 0
2. (1, -1, 0) and permutations - Sum: 0
(there are $\binom{3}{1} \cdot \binom{2}{1} = 3 \cdot 2 = 6$ ways to choose the positions for 1, -1, and 0 in a triple).

So there are $1 + 6 = 7$ possible triples.

Actually, let me think about this more carefully. The key is to satisfy the constraints:
$a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$
$a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$
$a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$

For each constraint, we need to find how many ways we can select values for the three variables such that their sum is 0.

For three variables, each taking values from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, the possible combinations that sum to 0 are:
1. (-1, -1, 2) - Not valid.
2. (-1, 0, 1) - Valid.
3. (-1, 1, 0) - Valid.
4. (0, -1, 1) - Valid.
5. (0, 0, 0) - Valid.
6. (0, 1, -1) - Valid.
7. (1, -1, 0) - Valid.
8. (1, 0, -1) - Valid.
9. (1, 1, -2) - Not valid.

Out of these, 6 combinations are valid. But since the order matters (we're selecting specific positions for each value), the total number of ways to satisfy each constraint is 6 (not considering the all zeros case).

Hmm, I think I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try a simpler approach:

For a single constraint like $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, with each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$, the possible valid combinations are:
1. (0, 0, 0) - Valid.
2. (-1, 0, 1) and permutations (3 ways) - Valid.
3. (-1, 1, 0) and permutations (3 ways) - Valid.
4. (1, -1, 0) and permutations (3 ways) - Valid.
5. (1, 0, -1) and permutations (3 ways) - Valid.

That's a total of 1 + 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13 ways for each constraint.

Actually, wait. I'm double counting combinations due to permutations.

Let me reason more directly. We want to count the number of ways to choose values for $(a_8, a_5, a_2)$ such that $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, with each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.

The possible valid combinations are:
1. (0, 0, 0) - Valid. (1 way)
2. (-1, 0, 1) and permutations - Valid. (6 ways)
3. (1, -1, 0) and permutations - Valid. (6 ways)

But (2) and (3) are really the same, just with -1 and 1 swapped. So there are 1 + 6 = 7 ways to satisfy each constraint.

So the total number of 9-tuples is $7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343$.

Actually, let's double check. I think I'm incorrect above. Let me re-evaluate the combinations:
1. (0, 0, 0) - Valid. (1 way)
2. (1, 0, -1), (0, 1, -1), (1, -1, 0), (0, -1, 1), (-1, 1, 0), (-1, 0, 1) - Valid. (6 ways)

So there are 1 + 6 = 7 ways to satisfy each constraint.

Therefore, the total number of 9-tuples is $7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343$.
