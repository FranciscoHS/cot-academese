Let me solve these AIME problems one by one.

PROBLEM 1:
We need the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity: $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}$, where $\omega^3 = 1$ and $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$.

For the polynomial to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, it must equal 0 at both $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

So we need:
$a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$a_8\omega^{16} + a_7\omega^{14} + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$  
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$

And for $\omega^2$:
- $(\omega^2)^8 = \omega^{16} = \omega$
- $(\omega^2)^7 = \omega^{14} = \omega^2$


- etc.

So our conditions become:
$a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$a_8\omega + a_7\omega^2 + a_6 + a_5\omega + a_4\omega^2 + a_3 + a_2\omega + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

I'll rearrange the terms to simplify the complex conditions. The key is to group similar powers of $\omega$ together, which will help us understand the constraints on the coefficients.

Grouping by powers reveals three independent equations where the coefficients must balance out to zero. Since $1, \omega, \omega^2$ are linearly independent, each group must independently sum to zero.

This means we need three separate conditions where each set of three coefficients ($a_0

Let me solve each problem one by one.

PROBLEM 1:
We need the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ are the primitive cube roots of unity: $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$.

For the polynomial to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, it must equal 0 at both roots.

So we need:
$a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1(\omega^2) + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \mod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \mod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^6 = \omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$

So the first condition becomes:
$a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
 
I can rearrange the terms by collecting coefficients of each power of $\omega$. The grouped terms reveal a pattern where the sum of coefficients at each power of $\omega$ must equal zero. Specifically, the coefficients of $1$, $\omega$, and $\omega^2$ form separate groups that must sum to zero.

Each group consists of three variables from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$. I'll need to count the number of ways these three variables can sum to zero. The first combination is the trivial case of $(0, 0, 0)$, which provides one solution. Another potential combination involves $(1, -1, 0)$, suggesting multiple ways to satisfy the constraint.

Counting the permutations reveals 6 distinct arrangements for each equation. Combining these possibilities across the three independent equations yields a total of $7^3 = 343$ potential solutions.

For the second problem, I'm examining the least common multiple relationship involving $2n$ and $n^2$. By decomposing $n$ into its prime factors, specifically $n = 2^a \cdot m$ where $m$ is an odd number, I can analyze the structure of the least common multiple.

When $a = 0$, the least common multiple simplifies to $2m^2$. For cases where $a \geq 1$, the least common multiple becomes $n^2$.

Solving the first case with $n$ as an odd number leads to the quadratic equation $n^2 - 31n + 168 = 0$. This yields two potential solutions, but only $n = 7$ satisfies the odd number constraint.

The second case involves even values of $n$, which requires further investigation into the equation's constraints.

Verifying the solutions reveals three valid $n$ values: 6, 7, and 56. Each value produces a consistent least common multiple when tested.

Calculating the final result involves multiplying these values: $6 \cdot 7 \cdot 56 = 2352$. The modulo operation yields the final answer of $352$.

The next problem involves a complex relationship between greatest common divisor and least common multiple. The equation seems challenging, requiring a systematic and careful approach to unravel its underlying structure.

The fourth problem involves a binomial expansion with a complex summation. By defining $f(x)$ as a polynomial function, the problem suggests an intricate computational challenge related to polynomial evaluation and binomial coefficients.

The key insight emerges through the binomial theorem: $(1-1)^{717}$ evaluates to zero, which fundamentally impacts the polynomial calculation. The approach involves exploring how this zero affects the overall summation of the polynomial.

The fifth problem introduces a dynamic sequence where Perry's
