--- CHAIN OF THOUGHT ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thinking block 1]
Let me solve each problem step by step.

PROBLEM 1:
We need $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity $\omega$ and $\omega^2$, where $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$.

For divisibility, we need:
$\sum_{i=0}^{8} a_i \omega^i = 0$ and $\sum_{i=0}^{8} a_i \omega^{2i} = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^0 = 1, \omega^1 = \omega, \omega^2 = \omega^2, \omega^3 = 1, \omega^4 = \omega, \omega^5 = \omega^2, \omega^6 = 1, \omega^7 = \omega, \omega^8 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^{2 \cdot 0} = 1, \omega^{2 \cdot 1} = \omega^2, \omega^{2 \cdot 2} = \omega, \omega^{2 \cdot 3} = 1, \omega^{2 \cdot 4} = \omega^2, \omega^{2 \cdot 5} = \omega, \omega^{2 \cdot 6} = 1, \omega^{2 \cdot 7} = \omega^2, \omega^{2 \cdot 8} = \omega$

So we need:
$(a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$


$S_0 + S_1\omega + S_2\omega^2 = 0$, where $S_0$ represents the sum of coefficients in groups of three, starting from the constant term. This equation ensures divisibility by the quadratic factor.

The key constraint is $S_0 = S_1 = S_2$, derived from the fundamental property $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$. 

Each $S_j$ can take values from $\{-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\}$, reflecting the possible combinations of coefficients $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.

I'll explore the possible values of $S$ that satisfy these conditions.

For each $S$ value, I'll count the distinct ways to form triples $(a_0, a_3, a_6)$, $(a_1, a_4, a_7)$, and $(a_2, a_5, a_8)$ summing to $S$. The distribution of ways ranges from a single combination at extreme values to multiple arrangements at intermediate sums.

Calculating the total involves cubing each sum's count and aggregating: $1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 = 831$ total configurations.
