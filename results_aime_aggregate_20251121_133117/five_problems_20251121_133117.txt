--- CHAIN OF THOUGHT ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thinking block 1]
Let me work through each problem systematically.

PROBLEM 1:
We need $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ such that $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.
The polynomial is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$ if and only if it vanishes at both roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

So we need:
$a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$a_8\omega^{16} + a_7\omega^{14} + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have $\omega^8 = \omega^2$, $\omega^7 = \omega$, $\omega^6 = 1$, $\omega^5 = \omega^2$, $\omega^4 = \omega$, $\omega^3 = 1$.

So the first equation becomes:
$a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$(a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0) = 0$
 
Following the same pattern for the second equation, I'll group terms with $\omega$ and $\omega^2$. The equation transforms into a similar form, with coefficients rearranged to create a system of constraints on the $a_i$ values.

By introducing variables $A$, $B$, and $C$ representing grouped coefficients, I discover a critical relationship. The key insight emerges when comparing two similar equations: they must be equivalent only if $A = B = C$. This means the coefficients must satisfy a symmetric condition across different powers of $\omega$.

The algebraic manipulation reveals that for the equation to hold, the grouped coefficients must be equal, forcing a specific structure on the original coefficients. This symmetry constraint provides a fundamental condition for the solution.

To explore this constraint, I'll systematically examine possible combinations of $-1, 0, 1$ that can create equal sums. I'll count the ways each possible sum can be achieved, focusing on the distribution of values that satisfy the symmetric requirement.

For sums ranging from $-3$ to $3$, I'll methodically track the number of unique ways these sums can be constructed using the allowed values.

The total count of possible configurations emerges by cubing the number of ways each sum can be generated: $1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 = 831$.

This systematic counting reveals the intricate combinatorial possibilities within the tight constraints of using only $-1, 0, 1$ and requiring equal sums across specific algebraic relationships.

For the second problem, I'll analyze the least common multiple (LCM) of $2n$ and $n^2$ by decomposing $n$ into its prime factors. When $n = 2^a \cdot m$, the LCM depends critically on the exponent $a$ and the odd component $m$.

Two distinct scenarios emerge: when $a = 0$, the LCM is $2m^2$, and when $a \geq 1$, the LCM becomes $n^2$ itself. This reveals a fascinating structural relationship between $n$'s prime factorization and its least common multiple.

The first case considers $n$ as an odd number, where $a = 0$ and $n = m$.

Solving the quadratic equation yields two potential values: $n = 7$ or $n = 24$. However, since $n$ must be odd, $n = 7$ becomes the sole valid solution.

In the second case, where $n$ is even and $a \geq 1$, the quadratic equation provides $n = 56$ or $n = 6$ as potential solutions. Both satisfy the evenness requirement.

Verification confirms the mathematical integrity, showing precise alignment between the LCM calculations and the original equation's constraints.

The final product $P$ equals $2352$, with its modulo $1000$ value being $352$. A careful double-check validates the initial calculation, ensuring computational accuracy.

The subsequent problems appear to involve complex mathematical techniques, including binomial theorem, divisibility properties, and probabilistic expected value calculations. I'll prioritize resolving the first two problems before addressing the remaining challenges.
