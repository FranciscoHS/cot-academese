If a polynomial $P(x) = a_8 x^8 + a_7 x^7 + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, then the roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ must also be roots of $P(x)$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ where $\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3}$ is a primitive cube root of unity. Note that $\omega^3 = 1$ and $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$.

For the polynomial to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need:
- $P(\omega) = 0$
- $P(\omega^2) = 0$

Let me compute $P(\omega)$:
$P(\omega) = a_8 \omega^8 + a_7 \omega^7 + a_6 \omega^6 + a_5 \omega^5 + a_4 \omega^4 + a_3 \omega^3 + a_2 \omega^2 + a_1 \omega + a_0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we can reduce the powers:
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So:
$P(\omega) = a_8 \omega^2 + a_7 \omega + a_6 + a_5 \omega^2 + a_4 \omega + a_3 + a_2 \omega^2 + a_1 \omega + a_0$


$= (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$

This condition implies that the sum of coefficients in each group of three must vanish. The pattern suggests a systematic grouping of polynomial coefficients based on their indices modulo 3.

By reducing the powers of $\omega$ and rearranging terms, I can see that the polynomial $P(\omega^2)$ transforms into a compact form where coefficients are strategically clustered. The key observation is how $\omega$ powers collapse under modular reduction, creating a symmetric representation of the original polynomial.

The resulting equation

Let me work through this step by step.

We want to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that 
$$P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \cdots + a_1x + a_0$$
is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Since $x^2 + x + 1$ divides $P(x)$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1$ are the primitive cube roots of unity, which satisfy $\omega^3 = 1$ and $\omega \neq 1$. So $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

Let me compute $\omega^k$ for various powers:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So the pattern repeats every 3 powers.

Now, $P(\omega) = 0$ gives us:
$$a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$$


I'll substitute the powers of $\omega$ to simplify this equation. When I replace each $\omega^k$ with its equivalent from the pattern, I get a grouped equation where the coefficients of $1$, $\omega$, and $\omega^2$ must sum to zero.

Specifically, the equation becomes:
$$(a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$$

This means the grouped coefficients create a constraint on our original 9-tuple. I'll continue the partial thought from the previous rewritten thinking:

= 0

This leads to three key linear independence constraints across the coefficients. I need to systematically count the ways three values from {-1, 0, 1} can sum to zero. The goal is to determine the possible combinations that satisfy these algebraic conditions, focusing on how the coefficients interact within this restricted set.

For the equation x + y + z = 0, where x, y, z are drawn from {-1, 0, 1}, I'll methodically explore the potential arrangements that balance to zero.

The solutions include permutations like (1, -1, 0) and the trivial case of (0, 0, 0). By carefully counting these combinations, I find 7 distinct ways to satisfy each constraint.

Since these three constraints operate independently, I can multiply their solution sets: $7^3 = 343$ total valid 9-tuples emerge from this algebraic construction.

I need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Since $P(x)$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we must have $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$, where $\omega$ is a primitive cube root of unity satisfying $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

We know that $\omega^3 = 1$, so $\omega^{3k+r} = \omega^r$ for any integers $k, r$.

Let's compute the powers of $\omega$ modulo 3:
- $\omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^4 = \omega$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^7 = \omega$
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

So:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$
$= (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2$


$P(\omega^2) = a_8\omega + a_7\omega^2 + a_6 + a_5\omega + a_4\omega^2 + a_3 + a_2\omega + a_1\omega^2 + a_0$
$= (a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega^2$

When setting these expressions to zero, I observe that the coefficients must satisfy specific conditions. The first terms $(a_0 + a_3 + a_6)$ must be zero, and the grouped coefficients of $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ must also sum to zero.

I'll count the possible solutions where $a, b, c \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and $a + b + c = 0$. This means finding all unique combinations that balance to zero using these three values.

The possible sums of $a + b$ range from $-2$ to $2$. I'll systematically check each case:

- When $a + b = -2$, no valid $c$ exists in the set.
- When $a + b = -1$, $c$ must equal $1$, which works.
- When $a + b = 0$, $c$ must equal $0$, which works.
- When $a + b = 1$, $c$ must equal $-1$, which works.
- When $a + b = 2$, the solution is incomplete due to $c$ being outside the allowed range.

I'll carefully count the valid combinations for each sum. For $a + b = -1$, there are 2 possible $(a,b)$ pairs, with $c = 1$. For $a + b = 0$, 3 possible pairs exist, with $c = 0$. For $a + b = 1$, 2 pairs work, with $c = -1$.

This yields $2 + 3 + 2 = 7$ solutions per equation. With 3 independent equations, the total number of 9-tuples is $7^3 = 343$.
