    "solution": "First, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for divisibility. \\begin{claim*} The divisibility occurs if and only if $ a_6+a_3+a_0 = a_7+a_4+a_1 = a_8+a_5+a_2. $ \\end{claim*} \\begin{proof} Notice that $x^3 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{x^2+x+1}$; in other words, we may take all exponents modulo $3$. Consequently, the original polynomial satisfies the congruences \\begin{align*} &\\phantom= a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \\dots + a_1x + a_0 \\\\ &\\equiv a_8 x^2 + a_7 x^1 + a_6 x^0 + a_5 x^2 + \\dots + a_1 x + a_0 \\pmod{x^2+x+1} \\\\ &= (a_8+a_5+a_2)x^2 + (a_7+a_4+a_1)x + (a_6+a_3+a_0). \\end{align*} This implies the result. \\end{proof} To extract the count, we will do casework by the value of the common sum $ S \\coloneqq a_6+a_3+a_0 = a_8+a_5+a_2 = a_7+a_4+a_1. $ Owing to the symmetry, the contribution for a given $S$ will be exactly the cube of the number of triplets achieving that sum $S$. This full list of such triplets is shown below. \\begin{center} \\begin{tabular}{ccc} Value of $S$ & Number & Triplet(s), up to permutation \\\\ \\hline $S = 3$ & $1$ & $(1,1,1)$ \\\\ $S = 2$ & $3$ & $(1,1,0)$ \\\\ $S = 1$ & $6$ & $(1,0,0)$ and $(1,1,-1)$ \\\\ $S = 0$ & $7$ & $(1, -1, 0)$ and $(0,0,0)$ \\\\ $S = -1$ & $6$ & $(-1,0,0)$ and $(-1,-1,1)$ \\\\ $S = -2$ & $3$ & $(-1,-1,0)$ \\\\ $S = -3$ & $1$ & $(-1,-1,-1)$ \\end{tabular} \\end{center} (Note that the triplets for $S$ and $-S$ are in obvious bijection, which limits us to only four different cases. As a further check, the sum of the number of triplets is indeed $1+3+6+7+6+3+1 = 27 = 3^3$.) Therefore, the final answer is $ 1^3 + 3^3 + 6^3 + 7^3 + 6^3 + 3^3 + 1^3 = \\boxed{831}. $",

We can rearrange this to get $ n^2 - 62n + 336 = 0 $ which factors as $ (n-6)(n-56) = 0 $ so $n = 6$ and $n = 56$; and these both work because they are even. \\item If $n$ is odd, then $\\opname{lcm}(2n,n^2) = 2n^2 = 62n - 336$.

(Thus, $X_1$ is always $14$, while $X_2$ is either $15$ or $41$ with equal probability, etc.) And as usual, let $\\mathbb E[\\bullet]$ denote expected value. By linearity of expectation, the desired answer equals $ \\mathbb E[X_1 + \\dots + X_5] = \\mathbb E[X_1] + \\dots + \\mathbb E[X_5]. $ \\begin{claim*} We have $\\mathbb E[X_i] = 2 \\mathbb E[X_{i-1}]$ for $i=2,\\dots,5$. \\end{claim*} \\begin{proof} Armed with the magic that is linearity of expectation, the following proof is actually completely airtight: \\begin{align*} \\mathbb E[X_i] &= \\frac{\\mathbb E[X_{i-1} + 1]}{2} + \\frac{\\mathbb E[3X_{i-1} - 1]}{2} \\\\ &= \\frac{(\\mathbb E[X_{i-1}] + 1) + (3 \\mathbb E[X_{i-1}] - 1)}{2} \\\\ &= 2\\mathbb E[X_{i-1}]. \\qedhere \\end{align*} \\end{proof} Hence, the expected pieces of bamboo eaten doubles every day. As such, our answer is (again by linearity of expectation) $ \\mathbb E[X_1] + \\dots + \\mathbb E[X_5] = 14(1+2+2^2+2^3+2^4) = 14 \\cdot 31 = \\boxed{434}. $ \\begin{remark*} When we compare the two solutions, we see that the elementary solution had two main ``insights'': first to sum across the rows instead of by the branches, and then that the average value of each row is doubled compared to the preceding one. The advanced solution shows that \\emph{both} insights are actually each a special case of linearity of expectation. This demonstrates how powerful the linearity of expectation theory is: it ``automagically'' erases both main hurdles of the direct solution. \\end{remark*}",
