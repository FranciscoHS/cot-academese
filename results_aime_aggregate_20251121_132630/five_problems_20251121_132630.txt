--- CHAIN OF THOUGHT ---
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Thinking block 1]
Let me work through each of these problems.

PROBLEM 1:
We need the polynomial $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + ... + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$.

The polynomial is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$ if and only if it evaluates to 0 at both roots $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

So we need:
$a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + ... + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$a_8\omega^{16} + a_7\omega^{14} + ... + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
$\omega^8 = \omega^2$, $\omega^7 = \omega$, $\omega^6 = 1$, $\omega^5 = \omega^2$, $\omega^4 = \omega$, $\omega^3 = 1$, etc.

So the first condition becomes:
$a_8\omega^2 + a_7\omega + a_6 + a_5\omega^2 + a_4\omega + a_3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$(a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0) = 0$

Similarly for the second condition with $\omega^2$:


The equation transforms, revealing additional constraints on the coefficients. When we apply the properties of $\omega$, we find that for the polynomial to be divisible, specific coefficient relationships must hold. These relationships emerge from the symmetry of the roots and the cyclic nature of $\omega$.

The conditions require certain grouped coefficients to sum to zero, creating a system of linear constraints that must be satisfied for divisibility.

Analyzing the possible combinations of $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ for each constraint, we discover 7 unique ways to satisfy each equation. Since these constraints are independent, the total number of valid coefficient configurations becomes $7^3 = 343$ distinct arrangements.
