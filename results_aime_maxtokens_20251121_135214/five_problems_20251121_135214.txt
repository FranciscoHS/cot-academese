[Thinking block 1]
Alright, let me solve these AIME problems one by one.

**PROBLEM 1:**
We need to find 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that $a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $f(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$.

For $f(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $f(\omega) = 0$ where $\omega$ is a root of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity: $\omega = e^{2\pi i/3}$ and $\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i/3}$.

Note that $\omega^3 = 1$, $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$, so $\omega^2 = -\omega - 1$.

So we need $f(\omega) = 0$ and $f(\omega^2) = 0$.

$f(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + a_6\omega^6 + a_5\omega^5 + a_4\omega^4 + a_3\omega^3 + a_2\omega^2 + a_1\omega + a_0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2 + 2} = \omega^2$


- $\omega^7 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2 + 1} = \omega$  
- $\omega^6 = \omega^{3 \cdot 2} = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^{3 \cdot 1 + 2} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^{3 \cdot 1 + 1} = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$

Substituting these values, the equation becomes a simplified expression involving the coefficients and the roots of unity.

The polynomial evaluates to zero when grouped coefficients sum to zero across three specific conditions. These conditions arise from the properties of $\omega$ as a primitive cube root of unity. The symmetry in the constraints suggests a structured relationship between the coefficients $a_0$ through $a_8, ensuring the polynomial vanishes at specific roots.

The key constraints require that triads of coefficients - offset by specific indices - must collectively sum to zero, reflecting the cyclic nature of the roots of unity.

For each equation involving three coefficients chosen from $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, there are 7 possible solution combinations. Since these three equations are independent, the total number of solutions becomes $7^3 = 343$, representing a systematic exploration of coefficient arrangements that satisfy the polynomial's zero condition.

Considering the least common multiple problem, I'll decompose $n$ into $2^a \cdot m$, where $m$ is an odd number. This allows me to analyze the LCM of $2n$ and $n^2$ systematically. By examining different exponent scenarios, I can determine how the least common multiple varies based on the value of $a$. When $a \geq 1$, the LCM simplifies to $n^2$, while the $a = 0$ case yields a different result of $2m^2$.

Solving the quadratic equation $n^2 - 62n + 336 = 0$, I find two potential solutions: $n = 56$ or $n = 6$. Using the quadratic formula, I calculate these values precisely. For $n = 56$, I verify that $\text{lcm}(2 \cdot 56, 56^2) = 3136 = 56^2$, confirming the solution. The case for $n = 6$ remains partially evaluated.

In the second scenario where $a = 0$, I explore an odd $n$ value. By solving $m^2 - 31m + 168 = 0$, I determine $m = 24$ or $m = 7$. Since $m$ must be odd, I select $m = 7$, which implies $n = 7$. I validate this by checking $\text{lcm}(14, 49) = 98$ and confirming the equation's constraints.

The positive integers $n$ are $6, 7, 56$, yielding a product $P = 2352$. When divided by 1000, the result is $352$.

For Problem 3, I begin analyzing the relationship between greatest common divisors and least common multiples. I introduce variables $d$ and $g$ to represent the GCD of $a$ and $b$, and the GCD of $b$ and $c$, respectively. I note the need for compatibility between these divisors.

Shifting strategy, I explore simpler scenarios by setting $b = 1$. This simplification leads to an equation involving least common multiples. I observe that $\text{lcm}(c,a)$ must be at least as large as the maximum of $c$ and $a$, which constrains potential solutions. The case where $c = 1$ seems particularly interesting, suggesting a potential path to understanding the broader problem.

Investigating specific values like $c = 1$ and $c = 2$ reveals no straightforward integer solutions. The constraints become increasingly complex, making direct resolution challenging. The computational complexity suggests a need for alternative problem-solving approaches.

I'll explore a computational strategy by examining small values and searching for underlying patterns. The problem involves a sophisticated summation involving binomial coefficients and a complex exponential expression.

The key insight emerges from connecting the summation to the binomial theorem. By expressing $(1+x)^{717}$ and considering $f(x) = (6+239x)^{717}$, I can potentially transform the summation into a more manageable form. The alternating signs and binomial coefficients hint at a deeper algebraic structure waiting to be uncovered.

The critical observation is the relationship between $717$ and $239$, specifically that $717 = 3 \cdot 239$. This numerical relationship might provide a breakthrough in simplifying the complex summation.

I'm sensing this requires a strategic decomposition of the expression, potentially leveraging the multiplicative properties of the binomial expansion and the specific numerical characteristics of the coefficients.

The forward difference operator offers an elegant transformation, allowing me to convert the intricate summation into a direct computation of $\Delta^{717} f(0)$ where $f(x) = (6+239x)^{717}$. 

A key insight emerges: when the degree matches the difference order, the result simplifies dramatically, potentially yielding $239^{717} \cdot 717!$ as a direct computation.

The next critical step involves determining the largest power of 2 dividing this massive numerical result.

Since 239 is odd, $239^{717}$ remains odd. I'll calculate $v_2(717!)$ through a systematic summation of floor divisions by increasing powers of 2.

The computation reveals 711 as the largest power of 2 in the factorial expansion, providing a precise characterization of the result's divisibility structure.

Perry's piece-eating scenario involves a probabilistic daily consumption model. Each day, he has an equal chance of either tripling the previous day's pieces minus one or adding one piece.

The expected number of pieces follows a geometric progression, doubling each subsequent day. Starting with 14 pieces, the expected consumption escalates rapidly: 28, 56, 112, 224, suggesting exponential growth in potential piece consumption.

The total expected pieces calculation remains incomplete in the current fragment.

[Thinking block 1]
I need to solve each problem one by one and provide just the answers in the required format.

PROBLEM 1:
Compute the number of $9$-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ of integers such that $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ for $i = 0, 1, \dots, 8$ and the polynomial $ a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0 $ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

For a polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, it must be zero at the roots of $x^2 + x + 1$.

The roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$ are the primitive cube roots of unity. Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, then $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$ and $\omega^3 = 1$.

The roots are $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

So we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$P(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$


- $\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$

These power reductions simplify the conditions for divisibility by $x^2 + x + 1$. By systematically applying these modular exponent rules, we can establish constraints on the coefficients $a_i$ that ensure the polynomial's divisibility.

The key observation emerges when evaluating $P(\omega)$, which yields a system of linear equations. Since $1, \omega, \omega^2$ form a linearly independent basis over $\mathbb{Q}$, each coefficient group must independently equal zero:
- $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$
- $a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$
- $a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$

This algebraic structure reveals the fundamental constraints governing the polynomial's coefficients.

When applying the same analysis to $P(\omega^2)$, an identical set of constraints emerges. The symmetry suggests a deeper underlying pattern in the polynomial's construction, with each constraint involving three variables that must balance to zero.

For the first constraint $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, the possible combinations are limited. We can have a zero sum through specific arrangements of -1, 0, and 1. These include a trivial case where all values are zero, and more interesting scenarios where positive and negative values offset each other.

The constraint allows for multiple configurations: a straightforward zero combination, and permutations where one variable is positive, another negative, and the third neutral. This creates a structured yet flexible framework for solving the equation.

Mathematically, we have 7 distinct ways to satisfy this single constraint, which becomes crucial when considering the broader system of equations. The combinations emerge from careful balancing of the allowed values, creating a precise set of solutions.

The complexity increases when we consider multiple such constraints and the interactions between free and constrained variables. This suggests a nuanced approach to understanding the total solution space.

I'll need to carefully analyze how these constraint mechanisms interact across the different variables, ensuring each equation can be consistently satisfied while maintaining the restricted value range.

For the first constraint involving $a_8, a_5, a_2$, I can select two variables freely from $\{-1,0,1\}$, which then determines the third variable. The key requirement is that the sum must remain within $\{-1,0,1\}$.

The possible combinations for $a_8 + a_5$ reveal interesting patterns: some pairs yield two possible arrangements, while others offer three distinct configurations. This suggests multiple potential solution pathways that maintain the constraint's strict conditions.

By systematically exploring these combinations, I find 7 total valid ways to satisfy this single constraint. Crucially, since the constraints for different variable pairs are independent, I can multiply these possibilities across three separate constraints.

The total number of valid tuples emerges from $7^3 = 343$ distinct arrangements that meet all specified conditions.

For the second problem, I'm investigating the relationship between $\lcm(2n, n^2)$ and $62n - 336$, which requires carefully analyzing the greatest common divisor and least common multiple of these expressions.

I'll decompose $n$ into its prime factor structure: $n = 2^a \cdot b$, where $b$ is an odd number and $a$ can be zero or positive. This allows me to systematically track how $2n$ and $n^2$ interact.

By examining the prime factorizations of $2n = 2^{a+1} \cdot b$ and $n^2 = 2^{2a} \cdot b^2$, I can determine their greatest common divisor will involve taking the minimum exponent of 2 and finding the GCD of the odd components.

When $a = 0$ (meaning $n$ is odd), the result simplifies to $n$ itself. For $a \geq 1$, the calculation becomes more nuanced, involving $2^{a+1}$ and the odd factor $b$.

The key insight is tracking how the powers of 2 and the odd component contribute to the final GCD, which depends critically on the structure of $n$'s prime factorization.

The results reveal two distinct scenarios:
- Odd numbers yield a GCD of $n$
- Even numbers produce a GCD of $2n$

This pattern emerges from the interplay between $2n$ and $n^2$'s prime decompositions.

For odd $n$, the least common multiple becomes $2n^2$, satisfying the equation $2n^2 = 62n - 336$.

Solving this quadratic requires the quadratic formula, which involves calculating $\sqrt{961 - 672}$ to determine potential integer solutions.

The solutions are $n = 24$ or $n = 7$, but since we need an odd $n$, $7$ is the valid choice.

For even $n$, the least common multiple is $n^2$, matching the equation $n^2 = 62n - 336$.

The quadratic formula reveals $n = 56$ or $n = 6$ as potential solutions, with both being valid since they are even numbers.

I'll need to verify these solutions by checking the specific conditions.

For $n = 7$, I calculate the least common multiple of $14$ and $49$ as $98$, which matches $2n^2$. The equation $62 \cdot 7 - 336 = 98$ also checks out.

For $n = 56$, I'll break down the prime factorizations of $112$ and $3136$ to determine their greatest common divisor and least common multiple.

The least common multiple is $3136$, which equals $n^2$. The verification $62 \cdot 56 - 336 = 3136$ confirms this result.

For $n = 6$, I find the least common multiple of $12$ and $36$ is $36$, matching $n^2$. The equation $62 \cdot 6 - 336 = 36$ validates this.

These calculations reveal the valid values of $n$ are $\{6, 7, 56\}$. I'll continue calculating the product $P$ of these values.

Multiplying $6 \cdot 7 \cdot 56$ yields $2352$. Taking this modulo $1000$ results in $352$.

Now I'm examining a new problem involving greatest common divisors and least common multiples, where I'll explore the conditions for integers satisfying a specific relationship.

I'll start by breaking down the problem's core constraint: finding integers where the GCD and LCM interact in a specific way. The initial observation reveals that simple cases like $z = 1$ or $z = 2$ quickly become mathematically impossible.

The equation $x + y = z^3$ requires careful analysis of how $x$ represents the GCD, $y$ represents the LCM, and $z$ relates these values. Small cases demonstrate the complexity of finding valid integer solutions.

For $z = 2$, the constraints narrow potential $(a,c)$ pairs to specific combinations. The valid pairs $(1,2)$, $(2,1)$, and $(2,2)$ emerge when exploring least common multiple conditions. Each pair introduces unique relationships between $x$, $y$, and the underlying integers.

When $a = 1$, the GCD constraint simplifies, leading to specific requirements for $b$ and $y$ that must simultaneously satisfy multiple mathematical conditions.

Investigating $b$'s potential values reveals intricate dependencies. Odd and even $b$ values create distinct scenarios where standard LCM calculations break down, preventing straightforward integer solutions.

The analysis demonstrates the complexity of simultaneously satisfying multiple number-theoretic constraints, revealing how seemingly simple conditions can quickly become mathematically restrictive.

When $b$ is odd, the GCD and LCM relationships prevent integer solutions. For even $b$, the constraints further limit potential values, showing the delicate balance required to meet the specified conditions.

I'll explore systematic approaches by examining small $b$ values to uncover underlying patterns. Starting with $b = 1$, I'll investigate the relationships between GCD, LCM, and the given equation constraints.

The goal is to find a more efficient method for determining valid $b$ values that satisfy the complex interplay between greatest common divisor and least common multiple.

By checking small integer values, I'm seeking a breakthrough that might reveal a broader solution strategy. The current approach involves carefully tracking the interactions between $c$, $a$, and $\ell$, looking for consistent mathematical relationships that could simplify the problem.

I've exhausted small integer checks for $c$ and $a$, finding no straightforward solutions. The equation involves complex constraints around least common multiples and greatest common divisors, suggesting this problem requires a more nuanced exploration beyond direct computational methods.

The mathematical structure hints at deeper algebraic complexity, prompting a shift in investigative approach. I'll need to consider alternative paths to unravel the underlying pattern.

For the specific case of $\lcm(c,a)^3 = 8$, I'm systematically examining potential integer combinations, methodically ruling out scenarios that fail to satisfy the intricate relational constraints.

When $(c, a) = (1, 2)$, I find two potential paths for $b$: an odd value of 7 or an even value of 6, each satisfying different divisibility conditions.

For $(c, a) = (2, 1)$, I discover an immediate contradiction. The least common multiple requirement cannot be met, as $\lcm(b, 2)$ cannot simultaneously equal 7 while maintaining the required relationship with $\gcd(b, 2)$.

When $(c, a) = (2, 2)$, I explore scenarios for $b$. Odd values lead to non-integer solutions, while even values suggest $b = 6$ as a valid candidate. This narrows potential values for $b$ to 6.

Expanding the analysis to $\lcm(c,a)^3 = 27$, I recognize that $\lcm(c,a) = 3$ implies specific combinations of $c$ and $a$. The possible pairs are $(1, 3)$, $(3, 1)$, and $(3, 3)$, each requiring careful examination of their divisibility properties.

For the case $(c, a) = (1, 3)$, I begin investigating the relationship between $\gcd(3, b)$ and $b$, seeking values that satisfy the complex constraint.

When $\gcd(3, b) = 1$, the solution points to $b = 26$. Alternatively, if $\gcd(3, b) = 3$, $b$ becomes 24.

Continuing through the remaining cases, I systematically explore the constraints for $(3, 1)$ and $(3, 3)$, finding similar patterns of potential $b$ values that satisfy the intricate divisibility conditions.

The computational complexity suggests deeper underlying mathematical relationships. I'm sensing a need to break down the problem using more fundamental number theory principles, potentially through strategic variable substitutions and careful tracking of greatest common divisors and least common multiples.

My current approach involves methodically examining different scenarios, tracking how $b$ changes under specific conditions, and seeking an underlying pattern that might simplify the problem's resolution.

The key observation is that $b$ seems constrained to two specific values: 24 and 26, which emerge from carefully analyzing the relationships between $\gcd$, $\lcm$, and the given equation.

I'm exploring systematic ways to understand how $k^3$ relates to $1 + b$, recognizing that the constraints suggest a nuanced interplay between these variables that requires precise mathematical reasoning.

The computational complexity indicates this problem demands a strategic, step-by-step deconstruction, potentially revealing elegant mathematical insights through careful variable manipulation and constraint analysis.

One key insight emerges: when $\lcm(c, a) = k$, both $c$ and $a$ must divide $k$, with $k$ representing the smallest positive integer accommodating both numbers. This divisibility relationship implies a structured connection between $c$, $a$, and $k$ that could provide critical problem-solving leverage.

By introducing $\gcd(c, a) = t$ and expressing $c$ and $a$ as $tc'$ and $ta'$ respectively, where $\gcd(c', a') = 1$, we're setting up a framework to systematically explore potential solutions.

The constraint transforms into a complex equation involving greatest common divisors and least common multiples, suggesting intricate numerical relationships that might yield an elegant resolution.

When $c = 1$, the equation simplifies to $\gcd(a, b) + b = a^3$, revealing $\gcd(a, b)$ as $a^3 - b$. This requires careful validation: $a^3 - b$ must be positive and divide both $a$ and $b$.

The relationship between $a^3 - b$ and $b$ involves nested greatest common divisor calculations, hinting at potential recursive patterns in number theory that could provide deeper insights into the constraint's structure.

Exploring $c = a$ introduces a new constraint linking $\gcd(a, b)$, $\lcm(b, a)$, and $a^3$. By leveraging the fundamental relationship $\gcd(a, b) \cdot \lcm(a, b) = ab$, we can derive a complex equation involving divisors and least common multiples.

The emerging algebraic structure suggests intricate dependencies between $a$, $b$, and their greatest common divisor, potentially revealing elegant mathematical relationships.

Applying the quadratic formula reveals stringent conditions: $a^6 - 4ab$ must be non-negative and a perfect square. This imposes strict limitations on $b$ relative to $a$, with $b$ constrained to $\leq \frac{a^5}{4}$.

Initial explorations for small values like $a = 1$ and $a = 2$ hint at the challenge of finding valid integer solutions, demonstrating the problem's complexity.

For $a = 2$, we seek $b$ values where $8(8 - b)$ becomes a perfect square. This requires $k^2$ divisible by 8 and less than 64, suggesting specific integer constraints that dramatically narrow potential solutions.

Examining the possible $k^2$ values, only 0 and 16 qualify as valid perfect squares. This yields two candidate $b$ values: 8 and 6. However, testing $b = 8$ reveals a critical issue - the resulting greatest common divisor fails to match the expected condition.

The investigation suggests a more nuanced approach is needed to find valid integer solutions that satisfy the complex constraints of the problem.

Rearranging the equation reveals a quadratic structure: $d^2 - 8d + 16 = 0$, which resolves to $d = 4$. Yet this solution introduces a fundamental contradiction with the initial $\gcd(a, b)$ requirement.

The core challenge lies in reconciling the relationships between $\gcd(a, b)$, $\lcm(a, b)$, and $a^3$, indicating a deeper algebraic complexity that resists straightforward resolution.

Exploring $a = 2, b = 6$ yields two potential $d$ values through the quadratic formula: 6 and 2. Critically, $\gcd(2, 6) = 2$ validates the $d = 2$ solution, marking a significant breakthrough in understanding the constraint's nuanced behavior.
