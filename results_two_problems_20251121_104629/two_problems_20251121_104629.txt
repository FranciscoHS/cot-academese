ID: 359
Type: integral
Question: Consider the integral $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$. Develop analytical formulas that approximate $I(\epsilon)$ for different regimes of $\epsilon$.

Reference Solution: 
    The integral is of the form $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19} \frac{1}{\epsilon + P(x)} dx$ where $P(x)$ is a polynomial. Thus, its value can be estimated as the product between a height and a width.
    Since the integrand is maximized at $x = 0$, the height can be set to  $frac{1}{\epsilon}$.

    For small  $epsilon$,
    we define the width as the point where the integrand becomes half of its maximum height.
    This corresponds to solving for $x$ given $P(x) = \epsilon$.
    Applying dominant balance, considering the term in $P(x)$ with the smallest degree, the width is approximated as $ \left( \frac{1}{8.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/7.0} $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for small  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.743}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}}$.

    For an intermediate regime where  $epsilon$ is large,
    we also define the width based on the term with the largest degree.
    The width is approximated as  $ \left( \frac{1}{8.0*\epsilon} \right)^{1/7.0}  $.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{0.743}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}}$.

    If the width of the integral exceeds the range of integration, we consider one more regime for very large  $epsilon$.
    The width is then just the range of integration, so in this regime, the integral can be approximated as  $frac{L}{\epsilon}$.
    Therefore, the analytical approximation of the integral for very large  $epsilon$ is  $boxed{I(\epsilon) = \frac{19}{\epsilon}}$.

    Altogether, the solutions at small, large, and very large  $epsilon$ are  $boxed{\frac{0.743}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \frac{0.743}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \frac{19}{\epsilon}}$.
    

Expected Answer: \frac{0.743}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \frac{0.743}{\epsilon^{0.8571}}, \frac{19}{\epsilon}

PROBLEM 2:

ID: 7
Type: nondimensionalization_symbolic
Question: Nondimensionalize the polynomial\[a_{1} x^{5} + a_{2} x + a_{3}\]into one of the form $\\epsilon y^{5} + y^{1} + 1.$Express $\\epsilon$ as a function of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3.$

Reference Solution: We begin with the substitution $x=\frac{a_{3} y}{a_{2}}$ 
This gives the expression  $frac{a_{1} a_{3}^{5} y^{5}}{a_{2}^{5}} + a_{3} y + a_{3}$ 
Divide by the coefficient remaining in front of the constant, leaving us with the nondimensionalized polynomial with coefficients in terms of $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$: $ \boxed{\frac{a_{1} a_{3}^{4} y^{5}}{a_{2}^{5}} + y + 1}.$ By inspection, we can see that $ \boxed{\epsilon=\frac{a_{1} a_{3}^{4}}{a_{2}^{5}}}.$ 

Expected Answer: \frac{a_{1} a_{3}^{4}}{a_{2}^{5}}

[Thinking block 1]
Let me solve both problems step by step.

PROBLEM 1:
We have $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$.

For different regimes of $\epsilon$, I need to consider:
1. When $\epsilon$ is very large compared to $8x^7$ over the integration range
2. When $\epsilon$ is very small compared to $8x^7$ over most of the integration range
3. Intermediate cases

For large $\epsilon$:
When $\epsilon >> 8x^7$ for all $x$ in [0, 19], we can approximate:
$I(\epsilon) \approx \int_0^{19} \frac{1}{\epsilon} dx = \frac{19}{\epsilon}$

For small $\epsilon$:
When $\epsilon << 8x^7$ for most of the range, we need to be more careful. The integrand becomes very large near $x = 0$ but small for larger $x$.

Let me think about this more systematically. We have:
$I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8x^7} dx$

For small $\epsilon$, the main contribution comes from small $x$ where $8x^7 \sim \epsilon$. 

Let me substitute $u = x^7$, so $x = u^{1/7}$ and $dx = \frac{1}{7}u^{-6/7}du$.
When $x = 0$, $u = 0$. When $x = 19$, $u = 19^7$.

$I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19^7} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8u} \cdot \frac{1}{7}u^{-6/7} du$


I'll split the integral into two regions based on the behavior near small $\epsilon$. The first region focuses on values near $u \sim \epsilon/8$, while the second region covers larger $u$ values.

PROBLEM 2:
I'll approach the nondimensionalization by introducing a scaling factor $\alpha$ to transform $a_1 x^5 + a_2 x + a_3$ into $\epsilon y^5 + y + 1$.

By setting $x = \alpha y$, I'll derive the appropriate scaling relationship between the coefficients and the new variables.

Comparing the transformed equation reveals key constraints on $\alpha$ and the coefficients. I'll solve for $\alpha$ using the coefficient relationships, noting that $a_3$ must equal 1 for an exact transformation.

When $a_3 \neq 1$, I'll modify the approach by scaling the entire original equation by $a_3$, transforming it into $a_3(\epsilon y^5 + y + 1)$ to maintain the desired nondimensional form.

By substituting $x = \alpha y$, I derive coefficient relationships that connect $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, $\alpha$, and $\epsilon$. The critical equations emerge from matching $y^5$ and $y$ terms, revealing how $\alpha$ depends on $a_2$ and $a_3$.

The resulting expressions show $\alpha = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$ and $\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^4}{a_2^5}$, providing a systematic way to transform the original polynomial form.

I'll solve both problems systematically.

## PROBLEM 1

Consider the integral $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$.

### Solution:

I'll analyze different asymptotic regimes for $\epsilon$.

**Regime 1: Large $\epsilon$ (when $\epsilon \gg 8 \cdot 19^7$)**

When $\epsilon$ dominates the denominator throughout the integration range:
$$I(\epsilon) \approx \int_0^{19} \frac{1}{\epsilon} dx = \frac{19}{\epsilon}$$

**Regime 2: Small $\epsilon$ (when $\epsilon \ll 8 \cdot 19^7$)**

For small $\epsilon$, the main contribution comes from the region near $x = 0$ where $8x^7 \sim \epsilon$.

Making the substitution $u = 8x^7$, so $x = \left(\frac{u}{8}\right)^{1/7}$ and $dx = \frac{1}{56} u^{-6/7} du$:

$$I(\epsilon) = \frac{1}{56} \int_0^{8 \cdot 19^7} \frac{u^{-6/7}}{\epsilon + u} du$$

For small $\epsilon$, split the integral at $u = \epsilon$:

$$I(\epsilon) \approx \frac{1}{56} \left[\int_0^{\epsilon} \frac{u^{-6/7}}{\epsilon} du + \int_{\epsilon}^{\infty} \frac{u^{-6/7}}{u} du\right]$$

The first integral gives:
$$\frac{1}{56\epsilon} \int_0^{\epsilon} u^{-6/7} du = \frac{1}{56\epsilon} \cdot \frac{7}{1} \epsilon^{1/7} = \frac{\epsilon^{-6/7}}{8}$$

The second integral gives:
$$\frac{1}{56} \int_{\epsilon}^{\infty} u^{-13/7} du = \frac{1}{56} \cdot \frac{7}{6} \epsilon^{-6/7} = \frac{\epsilon^{-6/7}}{48}$$

Therefore, for small $\epsilon$:
$$I(\epsilon) \approx \frac{\epsilon^{-6/7}}{8} + \frac{\epsilon^{-6/7}}{48} = \frac{7\epsilon^{-6/7}}{48}$$

**Summary of approximations:**
- **Large $\epsilon$**: $I(\epsilon) \approx \frac{19}{\epsilon}$
- **Small $\epsilon$**: $I(\epsilon) \approx \frac{7\epsilon^{-6/7}}{48}$

## PROBLEM 2

Nondimensionalize the polynomial $a_1 x^5 + a_2 x + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^5 + y + 1$.

### Solution:

To transform the polynomial, I'll use the substitution $x = \alpha y$ and scale the entire expression.

Let the transformed polynomial be:
$$a_1 x^5 + a_2 x + a_3 = a_3(\epsilon y^5 + y + 1)$$

Substituting $x = \alpha y$:
$$a_1 \alpha^5 y^5 + a_2 \alpha y + a_3 = a_3 \epsilon y^5 + a_3 y + a_3$$

Comparing coefficients:
- **Coefficient of $y^5$**: $a_1 \alpha^5 = a_3 \epsilon$
- **Coefficient of $y$**: $a_2 \alpha = a_3$  
- **Constant term**: $a_3 = a_3$ ✓

From the second equation:
$$\alpha = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$$

Substituting into the first equation:
$$\epsilon = \frac{a_1 \alpha^5}{a_3} = \frac{a_1}{a_3} \left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^5$$

Therefore:
$$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^4}{a_2^5}}$$

**Verification:** The transformation is $x = \frac{a_3}{a_2} y$, and dividing the original polynomial by $a_3$ gives:
$$\frac{a_1 a_3^4}{a_2^5} y^5 + y + 1 = \epsilon y^5 + y + 1$$

[Thinking block 1]
Let me solve both problems step by step.

**PROBLEM 1:**
We have $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$.

I need to find analytical approximations for different regimes of $\epsilon$.

Let me consider two main regimes:
1. Small $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \ll 8.0 x^{7.0}$ for most of the integration range)
2. Large $\epsilon$ (i.e., $\epsilon \gg 8.0 x^{7.0}$ for most of the integration range)

**Case 1: Small $\epsilon$**
When $\epsilon$ is small, we have $\epsilon \ll 8.0 x^{7.0}$ except near $x = 0$.

For most of the integration range, we can approximate:
$\frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} \approx \frac{1}{8.0 x^{7.0}}$

So $I(\epsilon) \approx \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{8.0 x^{7.0}} dx = \frac{1}{8.0} \int_0^{19.00} x^{-7.0} dx$

But wait, this integral diverges at $x = 0$! So we need to be more careful.

Let me think about this differently. We need to consider where $\epsilon$ becomes comparable to $8.0 x^{7.0}$.

$\epsilon = 8.0 x^{7.0}$ gives us $x = \left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{1/7.0}$

So for $x \ll \left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{1/7.0}$, we have $\epsilon \gg 8.0 x^{7.0}$


For $x \gg \left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{1/7.0}$, we have $\epsilon \ll 8.0 x^{7.0}$

I'll divide the integral into two regions to handle the different behaviors near and far from the critical point. This approach allows me to carefully manage the singularity at $x = 0$ and capture the integral's behavior across different scales.

In the first region near zero, $\epsilon$ dominates the denominator, leading to a straightforward approximation that scales as $\epsilon^{-6/7}$. The second region involves a different asymptotic behavior where $8.0 x^{7.0}$ becomes the primary term, suggesting a distinct scaling regime.

I'll evaluate the integral by separating the limits and applying standard integration techniques. The result involves comparing the contributions from the lower and upper bounds, with a key focus on how the power of $x$ transforms the integral's structure.

The computation reveals a complex interplay between the small parameter $\epsilon$ and the integration limits, resulting in a nuanced expression that captures the asymptotic scaling of the original integral.

By examining the behavior for small $\epsilon$, I notice the lower bound term becomes dominant, leading to an approximation that scales with a fractional negative power of $\epsilon$. The final form elegantly captures this scaling relationship through a carefully constructed coefficient.

The integral's asymptotic behavior emerges from the interplay between the exponential terms, demonstrating how subtle changes in integration limits can dramatically influence the result's mathematical character.

When $\epsilon$ grows substantially larger than the integration range, the approximation simplifies dramatically, reducing to a straightforward linear scaling with the upper limit.

For Problem 2, I'll transform the polynomial by introducing a scaled variable $y$ through $x = \alpha y$. This allows systematic matching of coefficients between the original and target forms. By setting up two key equations, I can determine the scaling factor $\alpha$ that enables nondimensionalization, specifically matching the $y^5$ and $y$ terms' coefficients.

The goal is establishing relationships between $a_1, a_2, a_3$ and $\epsilon$ that permit a clean transformation to the standard $\epsilon y^5 + y + 1$ structure.

I'll explore how different scaling approaches might reveal the connections needed to express $\epsilon$ systematically across the polynomial's coefficients.

By setting $x = \alpha y$, I can transform the original polynomial, revealing potential relationships between $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $\epsilon$. Dividing by $a_3$ suggests interesting scaling constraints, particularly around how $\alpha$ relates to the coefficients.

Specifically, I notice $\alpha$ needs to satisfy $\frac{a_2 \alpha}{a_3} = 1$, which implies $\alpha = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$. This scaling relationship looks promising for systematically connecting the coefficients.

The next step involves determining how $\epsilon$ emerges from this transformation, focusing on the coefficient of $y^5$ and understanding its precise relationship to $a_1$, $a_2$, and $a_3$.

I'll solve both problems systematically.

## PROBLEM 1

For the integral $I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$, I'll analyze different regimes of $\epsilon$.

### Small $\epsilon$ Regime

When $\epsilon$ is small, I need to identify where $\epsilon$ becomes comparable to $8.0x^{7.0}$.

The crossover occurs at $x_c = \left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{1/7}$.

I'll split the integral into two regions:

$$I(\epsilon) = \int_0^{x_c} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx + \int_{x_c}^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$$

**Region 1** ($x < x_c$): Here $\epsilon \gg 8.0x^{7.0}$, so:
$$\int_0^{x_c} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx \approx \int_0^{x_c} \frac{1}{\epsilon} dx = \frac{x_c}{\epsilon} = \frac{1}{\epsilon}\left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{1/7} = \frac{1}{8.0^{1/7}}\epsilon^{-6/7}$$

**Region 2** ($x > x_c$): Here $8.0x^{7.0} \gg \epsilon$, so:
$$\int_{x_c}^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon + 8.0 x^{7.0}} dx \approx \int_{x_c}^{19.00} \frac{1}{8.0 x^{7.0}} dx$$

$$= \frac{1}{8.0} \int_{x_c}^{19.00} x^{-7} dx = \frac{1}{8.0} \left[\frac{x^{-6}}{-6}\right]_{x_c}^{19.00}$$

$$= \frac{1}{48.0}\left[\left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{-6/7} - 19.00^{-6}\right]$$

Since $\epsilon$ is small, the first term dominates:
$$\approx \frac{1}{48.0} \cdot 8.0^{6/7} \epsilon^{-6/7}$$

**Combined result for small $\epsilon$:**
$$I(\epsilon) \approx \epsilon^{-6/7}\left(\frac{1}{8.0^{1/7}} + \frac{8.0^{6/7}}{48.0}\right) = \frac{7}{6 \cdot 8.0^{1/7}}\epsilon^{-6/7}$$

### Large $\epsilon$ Regime

When $\epsilon \gg 8.0x^{7.0}$ for all $x \in [0, 19.00]$:

$$I(\epsilon) \approx \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{\epsilon} dx = \frac{19.00}{\epsilon}$$

### Final Approximations

$$I(\epsilon) \approx \begin{cases}
\frac{7}{6 \cdot 8.0^{1/7}}\epsilon^{-6/7} & \text{for small } \epsilon \\
\frac{19.00}{\epsilon} & \text{for large } \epsilon
\end{cases}$$

## PROBLEM 2

To nondimensionalize $a_1 x^5 + a_2 x + a_3$ into the form $\epsilon y^5 + y + 1$:

I'll use the substitution $x = \alpha y$ where $\alpha$ is a scaling factor.

Substituting: $a_1(\alpha y)^5 + a_2(\alpha y) + a_3 = a_1\alpha^5 y^5 + a_2\alpha y + a_3$

To get the desired form, I'll divide the entire expression by $a_3$:

$$\frac{a_1\alpha^5}{a_3} y^5 + \frac{a_2\alpha}{a_3} y + 1$$

For this to match $\epsilon y^5 + y + 1$, I need:
- Coefficient of $y$: $\frac{a_2\alpha}{a_3} = 1$
- Constant term: $1 = 1$ ✓

From the first condition: $\alpha = \frac{a_3}{a_2}$

Therefore: $\epsilon = \frac{a_1\alpha^5}{a_3} = \frac{a_1}{a_3}\left(\frac{a_3}{a_2}\right)^5$

$$\boxed{\epsilon = \frac{a_1 a_3^4}{a_2^5}}$$

The transformation is: $x = \frac{a_3}{a_2}y$, and the original polynomial becomes $a_3(\epsilon y^5 + y + 1)$.
