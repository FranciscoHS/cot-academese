ANSWER: Partially Correct

Why? 
The answer to problem 2 is fully correct. The answer to problem is correct in the large \epsilon limit, and almost correct in the small \epsilon limit - the exponent of the \epsilon is correct, but the prefactor is off. It is quite a bit closer than with the 2000 budget.

THINKING SUMMARY (total tokens: 1072):
Phase transition at roughly 1/3rd - so around 350 tokens or so. Goes from very quantitative and short sentences, to wordier and less mathy. Exanmple of thinking early on:

"So $I(\epsilon) \approx \int_0^{19.00} \frac{1}{8.0 x^{7.0}} dx = \frac{1}{8.0} \int_0^{19.00} x^{-7.0} dx$

But wait, this integral diverges at $x = 0$! So we need to be more careful.

Let me think about this differently. We need to consider where $\epsilon$ becomes comparable to $8.0 x^{7.0}$.

$\epsilon = 8.0 x^{7.0}$ gives us $x = \left(\frac{\epsilon}{8.0}\right)^{1/7.0}$"

And later:

"I'll evaluate the integral by separating the limits and applying standard integration techniques. The result involves comparing the contributions from the lower and upper bounds, with a key focus on how the power of $x$ transforms the integral's structure.

The computation reveals a complex interplay between the small parameter $\epsilon$ and the integration limits, resulting in a nuanced expression that captures the asymptotic scaling of the original integral.

By examining the behavior for small $\epsilon$, I notice the lower bound term becomes dominant, leading to an approximation that scales with a fractional negative power of $\epsilon$. The final form elegantly captures this scaling relationship through a carefully constructed coefficient."

OBSERVATIONS:
The model stopped before the allowed budget was fully expended (1072 tokens used vs 2000 budget) even though it did not arrive at the correct response for one of the problems.
