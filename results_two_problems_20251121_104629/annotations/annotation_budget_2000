Budget 2000 tokens - 2025-11-21
================================================================================

ANSWER: Partially Correct

Why? 
The answer to problem 2 is fully correct. The answer to problem is correct in the large \epsilon limit, and almost correct in the small \epsilon limit - the exponent of the \epsilon is correct, but the prefactor is off.

THINKING SUMMARY (total tokens: 751):
All of the reasoning looks fairly concrete, with math symbols appearing 
throughout. No flowery language observed.

OBSERVATIONS:
The model stopped before the allowed budget was fully expended (751 tokens used vs 2000 budget) even though it did not arrive at the correct response for one of the problems.
