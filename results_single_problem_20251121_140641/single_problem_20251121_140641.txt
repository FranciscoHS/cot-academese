I need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \dots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ such that the polynomial $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \dots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let me first find the roots of $x^2 + x + 1 = 0$.
Using the quadratic formula: $x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1-4}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{-3}}{2} = \frac{-1 \pm i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Let $\omega = \frac{-1 + i\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and $\omega^2 = \frac{-1 - i\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

Note that $\omega$ and $\omega^2$ are the primitive cube roots of unity. We have $\omega^3 = 1$ and $1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \dots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$P(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \dots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:


$\omega^4 = \omega$, $\omega^5 = \omega^2$, $\omega^6 = 1$, $\omega^7 = \omega$, $\omega^8 = \omega^2$

Substituting these relations, I can simplify the equation for $P(\omega)$. By grouping terms with similar powers of $\omega$, I'll rearrange the polynomial to understand its divisibility condition.

The equation becomes: $(a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega^2 = 0$

Similarly, for $\omega^2$, I observe the same pattern of power relations: $(\omega^2)^4 = \omega^2$, $(\omega^2)^5 = \omega$, $(\omega^2)^6 = 1$, $(\omega^2)^7 = \omega^2$, $(\omega^2)^8 = \omega$

Applying the same grouping technique to $P(\omega^2)$ yields an analogous structure: $(a_0 + a_3 + a_6) + (a_2 + a_5 + a_8)\omega + (a_1 + a_4 + a_7)\omega^2 = 0$

Let $S_0 = a_0 + a_3 + a_6$, $S_1 = a_1 + a_4 + a_7$, $S_2 = a_2 + a_5 + a_8$. 

I derive two key equations: $P(\omega) = S_0 + S_1\omega + S_2\omega^2 = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = S_0 + S_2\omega + S_1\omega^2 = 0$

Rearranging these equations reveals an intriguing relationship between $S_0$, $S_1$, and $S_2$. By manipulating the terms, I find that $S_1 = S_2$, which emerges from a contradiction involving $\omega$ and $\omega^2$.

Substituting this result leads to a critical insight: $S_0 = S_1 = S_2$. This implies a symmetric condition across the array elements, where three specific sums are equal.

Mathematically, this translates to:
$a_0 + a_3 + a_6 = a_1 + a_4 + a_7 = a_2 + a_5 + a_8 = k$

I recognize each $a_i$ can only take values $-1$, $0$, or $1$, constraining the possible sum ranges from $-3$ to $3$. The next step involves counting the configurations that satisfy this condition for each potential value of $k$.

For $k = -3$, there's a single configuration: three $-1$'s. For $k = -2$, three distinct arrangements emerge involving two $-1$'s and one $0$. The $k = -1$ case requires more nuanced analysis of possible value combinations.

Systematically exploring each $k$ value reveals a pattern of configurations. Negative $k$ values start with fewer arrangements, gradually increasing in complexity. Permutations play a crucial role in counting distinct ways to arrange values.

The total count follows an interesting progression: from 1 arrangement at extreme values like $-3$ and $3$, to more varied combinations in the middle range. Each $k$ value presents unique constraints on possible $(x_1, x_2, x_3)$ triplets.

Calculating the total requires cubing the number of ways for each $k$ and summing across the range. This approach captures the combinatorial complexity, resulting in 831 total 9-tuples satisfying the specified constraints.

We need to find the number of 9-tuples $(a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_8)$ where each $a_i \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$ and the polynomial 
$P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$
is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

First, let me understand what it means for $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

The polynomial $x^2 + x + 1$ has roots that are the primitive cube roots of unity. Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$ and $\omega^3 = 1$. The other root is $\omega^2$.

For $P(x)$ to be divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$, we need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

So we need:
$P(\omega) = a_8\omega^8 + a_7\omega^7 + \ldots + a_1\omega + a_0 = 0$
$P(\omega^2) = a_8(\omega^2)^8 + a_7(\omega^2)^7 + \ldots + a_1\omega^2 + a_0 = 0$

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, we have:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^{8 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^7 = \omega^{7 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^6 = \omega^{6 \bmod 3} = \omega^0 = 1$


- $\omega^5 = \omega^{5 \bmod 3} = \omega^2$
- $\omega^4 = \omega^{4 \bmod 3} = \omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$
- $\omega^1 = \omega$
- $\omega^0 = 1$

Substituting these values, we can simplify the condition for $P(\omega)$ to be zero. The powers of $\omega$ reduce to a cyclic pattern, which allows us to express the equation more compactly.

The resulting system of equations requires three coefficients to sum to zero in each group. This creates constraints on the polynomial's coefficients that must be satisfied simultaneously.

For $P(\omega^2)$, the exponents follow a similar modular reduction pattern. The powers of $\omega^2$ create a distinct cyclic sequence, with each successive power transforming according to the modulo 3 operation.

When evaluating $P(\omega^2)$, the equation rearranges to reveal three key relationships:
- The first-degree $\omega$ terms combine
- The second-degree $\omega^2$ terms aggregate
- The constant terms sum

This leads to additional conditions mirroring the previous constraints, specifically requiring the same coefficient groups to sum to zero. The symmetry suggests a structured approach to solving the polynomial's roots within this specialized field.

For the first equation $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$, I'll systematically explore possible combinations. Each variable can take values -1, 0, or 1, creating multiple potential solution paths. The goal is to count valid configurations that satisfy the zero-sum constraint.

The initial combinations reveal interesting patterns of negative and zero sums, indicating the complexity of finding valid solutions across these three interconnected variables.

I notice solutions emerge in specific scenarios: when negative and positive values balance each other, creating zero-sum arrangements. Some combinations like $(-1) + 0 + 1 = 0$ or $0 + 0 + 0 = 0$ directly meet the equation's requirement.

The comprehensive list shows multiple zero-sum scenarios, suggesting multiple potential solution configurations for this single equation. Each combination represents a unique way three variables can interact to produce zero.

By identifying 7 distinct solutions for each equation and recognizing their independence, the total solution space expands multiplicatively. This means 7 possibilities for each of three independent equations results in $7^3 = 343$ total unique 9-tuple configurations.

The systematic exploration reveals the mathematical complexity hidden within seemingly simple constraints, where small integer values can generate substantial solution diversity.

Each constraint requires a precise combination of three variables from the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$, with the critical requirement that their sum equals zero. This creates an intricate pattern of valid arrangements that must satisfy the zero-sum condition across different variable sets.

By systematically enumerating the possible combinations, I find exactly 7 unique solutions where $x + y + z = 0$, including arrangements like $(-1, 0, 1)$, $(0, 0, 0)$, and $(1, -1, 0)$.

Given the independent nature of these three equations, I can multiply the number of solutions: $7^3 = 343$ total possible configurations that meet the specified constraints.

Looking at this problem, I need to find when $P(x) = a_8x^8 + a_7x^7 + \ldots + a_1x + a_0$ is divisible by $x^2 + x + 1$.

Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, so $\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0$ and $\omega^3 = 1$.

For divisibility, I need $P(\omega) = 0$ and $P(\omega^2) = 0$.

Since $\omega^3 = 1$, I can reduce the exponents modulo 3:
- $\omega^8 = \omega^2$, $\omega^7 = \omega$, $\omega^6 = 1$
- $\omega^5 = \omega^2$, $\omega^4 = \omega$, $\omega^3 = 1$
- $\omega^2 = \omega^2$, $\omega^1 = \omega$, $\omega^0 = 1$

So:
$P(\omega) = (a_8 + a_5 + a_2)\omega^2 + (a_7 + a_4 + a_1)\omega + (a_6 + a_3 + a_0)$

For $P(\omega) = 0$:
- $a_8 + a_5 + a_2 = 0$
- $a_7 + a_4 + a_1 = 0$  
- $a_6 + a_3 + a_0 = 0$

Similarly for $P(\omega^2) = 0$, I get the same three equations.

Now I need to count solutions to $x + y + z = 0$ where $x, y, z \in \{-1, 0, 1\}$.

The solutions are:
- $(-1, 0, 1)$, $(-1, 1, 0)$, $(0, -1, 1)$, $(0, 0, 0)$, $(0, 1, -1)$, $(1, -1, 0)$, $(1, 0, -1)$

That's 7 solutions for each constraint.

Since the three constraints are independent, the total number is $7^3 = 343$.
